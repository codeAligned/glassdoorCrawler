I'm 31, been depressed and getting worse since I was a little girl. Too much trauma, too much sadness, and BS. I hate that I have tried so hard, so many times to be a good person and help other and find purpose and found NOTHING. For over 15 years now. And lately I feel more purposeless and angry as ever. I feel empty and like this is just a horrible dream, I've been in between heaven and hell like a limbo/purgatory punishment place. Where nothing changes... No matter how hard I try. I get nothing. Why am I here?","author":"Whylive2suffer","postID":"post1863818","date":"20150705-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_727080.html"},{"content":"Welcome to e health forum.
