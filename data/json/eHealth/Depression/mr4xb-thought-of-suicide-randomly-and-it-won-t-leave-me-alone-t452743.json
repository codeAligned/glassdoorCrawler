If you are on drugs, then yes, you need to get off of them and \"go straight\". But if you are gay,that is perfectly fine and you don't have to \"go straight\". No matter what the cause,you need to ASAP have your parents or guidance counselor or someone who can do this for you-make an appointment with a mental health professional.Suicidal thoughts are considered a medical emergency so this should be done NOW. Meanwhile, you can call this 24 hour hotline to talk to a mental health professional. Tell them how you are feeling and let them guide you to how best to make an appointment. Here is that #-24/7: 1-800-273-8255. Note that these thoughts are NOT uncommon for any teenager, Rodger- you are not alone. Make some calls and get some help and it will be OK.
