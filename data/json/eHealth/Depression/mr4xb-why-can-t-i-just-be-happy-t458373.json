I've recently quit drinking and it's so hard to deal with my emotions..it reminds me why I kept on drinking after I started.. I hate feeling like this I don't do good dealing with my own thoughts I'm constantly trying to distract myself in any ways possible because once I start thinking I just throw myself into a very bad depression fit and I start crying and my head starts to hurt and I can't help the thought of how much I hate myself and how much of a failure I've been my whole life.. usually people get depressed and sleep. I get depressed and can't sleep when really all I want to do is sleep for a very long time. Atleast when I'm sleeping I'm not downing myself. Sometimes I wish everyone would just go away because they've seen me at my worse and it's so embarrassing I used to get stupid drunk and make a fool of myself now everyone knows I'm just a loser and they think I don't want to change when I have been trying it's just so hard not to run away from my emotions for once in my life I'm dealing with it sober and it hurts so much... I don't know why I do anything anymore other than to just be alive I feel so empty..","author":"ultimateloser","postID":"post1870480","date":"20150815-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_730182.html"},{"content":"Hey ultimateloser, I understand how your feeling. I've been feeling like this for a while now too and I am 22. It's gotten so worse to the point where I've been feeling suicidal. I feel like I am better off dead and I just can't take this pain anymore. Don't drink because it will make things worser. I always think that it will help but the next day I will always feel like crap and my anxiety goes tenfold, so that's why I don't drink anymore. I sleep a lot on the contrary, even though it doesn't help, its become a bad habit of mines. It may feel like you have made a lot of mistakes, but everyone makes mistakes, the only reason why yours seems worser is because your depressed. Everything seems worser than it truly is when you are depressed. Don't believe the lies, you should think about seeing a counselor or even try meds. Life is too short and you don't have to live like this. My prayers are with you.","author":"Zandy12","replyTo":"post1870480","postID":"post1870565","date":"20150815-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_729982.html"},{"content":"Some Home remedies which you can try for your depression: 1. plenty of good quality sleep 2.
