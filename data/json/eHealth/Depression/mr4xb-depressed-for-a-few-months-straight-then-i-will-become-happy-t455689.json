{"title":"depressed for a few months straight then I will become happy","thread":[{"content":"I have been feeling depressed for 10 months straight. I have self harmed a lot and whenever I'm around people after cutting, I become petrified that they know what I've done and they'll tell someone and that everyone will know. For the last few months, every time I think about food and before, during and after eating dinner I feel really sick and nauseous. I've stopped eating lunch, breakfast and my snacking has started to decrease. I am constantly cold and shaking. If, for example, I'm depressed for a few months straight then I will become happy, normal and fake. After another few months of this, I become really depressed again and it keeps going, over and over again but each time the amount of time changes for when I'm happy or depressed. I've got a feeing I have depression, anxiety and some kind of eating disorder but I'm not sure.

Any organic cause can also be looked for via certain investigation e.g thyroid function tests , blood counts. Behavioral cognitive therapy, psychotherapy and medications can then be advised accordingly.
