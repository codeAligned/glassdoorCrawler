{"title":"Withdrawal symptoms of cipralex (Page 1)","thread":[{"content":"I have been on 20mg of Cipralex for almost two years now and my doctor and I decided that I should start on Wellbutrin instead as I felt that the cipralex wasn't having the good effects that it used to. I am now on 300mg of Wellbutrin XL a day and was supposed to gradually reduce lmy cipralex dosage over a period of time to the point that I no longer needed it. Unfortunately, all these drugs cost money and I can't afford to take both. I stopped taking Cipralex cold turkey about 2 weeks ago and the past two days have been nothing short of hell for me. My tounge is constantly tingling, if I move my head to quickly I get these weird almost electric sound in my head (always three zap sounds each time), I am dizzy, not hungry, constantly tired, body feels as though it does not belong to me (lots of mumbling, clumsiness) and have been having very intense dreams where I wake up sweating so bad that my sheets are soaked. I guess my question is: It has already been 2 weeks and symptoms are becoming worse. How much longer do I have to suffer these withdrawal symptoms???","author":"Lamb01","postID":"post1520913","date":"20120304-00:00:00 -0500","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_478350.html"},{"content":"These are the listed withdrawal symptoms of Cipralex : .aggression, anxiety, balance issues , blurred vision, brain zaps, concentration impairment, constipation, crying spells, depersonalization, diarrhea, dizziness. electric shock sensations, fatigue, flatulence, flu-like symptoms, hallucinations, hostility, highly emotional, indigestion, irritability, impaired speech, insomnia, jumpy nerves, lack of coordination, lethargy, migraine headaches / increased headaches, nausea, nervousness, over-reacting to situations, paranoia, repetitive thoughts or songs, sensory & sleep disturbances, severe internal restlessness (akathasia), stomach cramps, tremors, tinnitus (ear ringing or buzzing), tingling sensations, troubling thoughts, visual hallucinations / illusions, vivid dreams, speech visual changes, worsened depression. So, quite a bit and explains why there is a need to taper off this drug. COst is one thing but taking risks is another. Best thing is to talk to your doctor and ask what to do now. If it's like most drugs it may take several weeks of pain before it settles down. Unavoidable since you've already done it.

I don't seem to have many of the other symptoms, but the zaps are so strong. I think I am in about week three now.

I stopped from there pretty abruptly but I wouldn't say cold turkey. I am in shock (pardon the pun) at how strong the shocks are. I'd started getting used to them but tonight, I wonder, is this normal? They seem to get worse in the evening. Sometimes I even wonder if my insides are convulsing or something!

Having never really taken any sort of serious prescription drug before, I had no idea how stupid that was. I've experienced a great deal of the listed symptoms and can say I was truly frightened and had no idea what was going on with my body. I don't want to know how much worse it would have been had I been on 20mg. Thankfully my mom and fiance are there for me and we managed to get me another two weeks until I can see my doctor again. I will definitely be more responsible with taking my pills consistently and on time.

Just to give you my background I was diagnosed with clinical depression in August 2011. It was triggered by months and months of extreme anxiety, sleeplessness and stress from starting my own business and believing I had to succeed at all costs. I had been seeing a psychologist for more than a year prior to my breakdown, in anticipation that the business would bring me a great deal of stress. NO idea it would get as bad as it did though and I finally made the choice to see a psychiatrist when I realised that although my behaviour had contributed to my breakdown, understanding those mistakes and learning from them alone wasn't going to get me out of the mess. My psychiatrist immediately put me on Cipralex plus anti anxiety meds and some sleeping pills to give me a chance to rest. Within a month the feelings of despair, helplessness, intense anxiety and pure lack of resources and ability to deal with the pressures in my life were, for the most part, gone. It was such a huge relief! But then the recommended minimum 18 months of ongoing medication started. I didn't want to be on medication, nobody wants to be on medication - not only is there stigma, but it's expensive and you're putting chemicals into your body. But I wanted to get better, be better and most importantly try stay better so I'd resigned myself to the reality that I had to stick to the plan, regardless of the how quickly I'd started feeling better and deferred to my psychiatrist on all counts. But oh my, the gradual lethargy that pretty much took over my life completely blindsided me. I started a relationship about 8 months into my treatment and the poor guy was convinced that he was dating a sloth! I thought I had lost the plot because I was at the point where I could easily sleep 14, 15 hours if left, and be able to do that easily 2 nights in a row (work commitments during the week prevented me from ever actually seeing how many nights in a row I could go for!) Inevitably the feelings of self loathing and the judgment started. And I started wondering had I always been like this? Or was I just more aware of it? Plus I was scared of the implications for my relationship. I felt lazy and useless and SO bored, despite not feeling depressed! Which totally bummed me out, which made me wonder if that meant I was still depressed and needed to stay on the medication?! Exactly the chicken and egg you're describing above! All I can say is thank the universe for my psychologist. I think our history prior to the depression helped, because she had a reference point for \"undepressed\" me. She kept pushing that the lethargy and \"laziness\" which I was so ashamed of, was a physical response, and not a psychological symptom. Unfortunately, it took me a while to start listening to her and believing her, because my 3-monthly check ups with my psychiatrist left me feeling like I still needed medication, subsequent dose increases, yet such disappointment and frustration as he didn't really seem to understand the negative effects the lethargy was having on me. I made the mistake of completely deferring to his medical judgment that the lethargy wasn't a big deal, because after all, he is the doctor and I had to trust that he knew what he was doing. Otherwise what was the point of any of it. And so it carried on. My psychologist eventually had a very candid conversation with me explaining that I had to trust myself, trust that I'm not a lethargic individual prone to sleeping away my weekends at the cost of not being active, not having fun in my relationship and not seeing my friends, and that I actually had a responsibility to voice my feelings about the medication more loudly and not just passively be \"steam rolled\" by my psychiatrist's treatment plan. My need to stop my medication and, as you say, get on with my life just became stronger and stronger and eventually I had the confidence to speak to my psychiatrist about all of it and the need to move on. It was a fantastically positive conversation. He was great. And it highlighted how I should have been more assertive in our sessions sooner, instead of just arriving to be treated, only to leave feeling more upset. But to be fair, that assertiveness only came with the confidence that I would be OK off meds and that it was time to try. We came up with a plan, because, as it's clear on this forum, the side effects if you go cold turkey can be absolutely horrific. So started the plan to taper me down from 20mg to 0. In January I was on 20mg and last week Monday I took my last 5mg dose. Just tapering my meds from 20mg down to 15mg, down to 10mg had a noticable difference within 2-4 weeks. I was shocked at what a difference I felt. I WANTED to get up in the mornings. My days were longer and enjoyable and it was such a small indication that I had made the right choice and that I could do this. And it only got better from there. It's only been 10 days of no Cipralex and I think I'm experiencing some final withdrawal - I'm having extreme moments of frustration and the inability to let go of things that bother me, which then inevitably result in some tears because on reflection I can see how ridiculous I'm being. My poor boyfriend. But I'm awake! And getting on with it! And it's great. The confidence alone, from taking the next step is a huge boost. I think it will take me a while to find my balance. So I expect the frustration and the random outbursts of annoyance and tears will be here for a while. But they're not in my character, so I trust they will eventually fade. Fingers crossed. And if not, well then I'll have to find a way to deal with them. *sigh* I haven't had any zaps that other people on the forum have described. Touch wood. There were some headaches and some sleeplessness. But nothing else that I've noticed. All I can offer you is my experience and my deepest empathy for what you're feeling, because I was THERE. Instead of judging yourself, remember why you started the medication in the first place, give it the recognition and respect it deserves but also acknowledge and understand it's limitations. When you break your leg, you put it in a cast. The cast serves a purpose, but you weren't born with it and wearing it for too long, especially once your leg's healed comes with it's own problems. Especially if you start believing you'll never be able to walk without it... Well that's what I think","author":"Meemee37","replyTo":"post1681816","postID":"post1694088","date":"20130404-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_605650.html"},{"content":"I think I made every mistake I possibly could have regarding coming off Cipralex. I've been on Cipralex for at least 2 yrs now, and felt that I was stable enough to come off. I didn't discuss it with my doctor, because I really don't think he knows any more about the drug than I do (maybe I'm wrong here too?). I decided to go from 20mg to 10 mg, which I did, for a little over 2 weeks. I tried to cut the pill in half again (to make a 5 mg) but it was too difficult without a pill cutter, so I just stopped altogether. That was about 2 or 3 weeks ago (I don't actually know when I stopped). I thought that was that. Then I started having crazy, vivid dreams, became sooo irritable and had no frustration tolerance. I feel lightheaded, have heart palpatations, cry at the drop of a hat, feel like ripping heads off anyone who comes too close, have these zappy shocks (thankfully mild), headaches, you name it - the list of withdrawl effects describes me to a tee. I felt such relief just now reading others' experiences because I thought I was losing my mind. I wish I had googled this BEFORE I stopped the damn drug. Now I'm not sure what to do, but may talk to the pharmacist where I work for advice on managing the withdrawl (i.e. do I suck it up for the next several weeks or do I take a reduced dose of the medication for a longer period of time) I have an appointment to see my GP and I will talk to him about this. What I was really afraid of was that the depression was back. Reading this has reassured me that that is not necessarily the case.

On day 4 quitting 5 mg Cipralex for 5 months. Mainly feeling the dizziness when moving my head at times - was afraid I had screwed sthg up in my neck doing yoga before reading these posts. On the more psychological withdrawal (i.e. anger - flipping out etc.) starting to feel these. I just would like my own experience with a softer approach to mood management i.e. Mindfulness Meditation. Tried that 3 years ago before resorting to meds for depression - it is call Mindfulness Cognitive Behaviour Therarpy (or MBCT). I feel the mindfulness practice (3 years off and on) is really helping with the withdrawal symptoms (as well as it helps with the onset symptoms of emotional roller coaster). Why? well simply because all the mindfulness practice does is teach oneself to observe one's thoughts or emotions - and simply get that millisecond of perspective to go \"Oh yeah, I am going at it again. I am.... [fill the blank: upset - sad - angry - etc.] Lots of online guided meditations (i.e. recordings) for whoever is interested - but also lots of \"crap\" out there (i.e. the Meta meditation or \"feel good\" types of visualizations - which is not what Mindfulness is really about. Another \"google\" keyword could be one of the US Psychologist who brought the mindfulness more mainstream in a hospital setting (in Boston, MA): John Kabat Zinn . I even found at my local public library some of his CDs with guided meditations - you can load the MP3s on a smart phone or Ipod or other play and practice anytime any where. Not to say this is a magic bullet - but it does help - basically to pick-up on the downward negative spiral - vicious circle of thoughts - and simply become aware of that spiralling of neg. thoughts (i.e. becoming mindful vs. on autopilot). I also understand it as \"rewiring\" the neural connections in our brain i.e. the associations of ideas and emotions we may have (auto-pilot) by first identifying them and as soon one thought pattern gets in the foreground vs. auto-pilot background, it is a start to lessenning the strenght of that neural connection (like taking a footpath, every day meaning to grass can grow, like sleep walking on it - then one day one goes - hmmmm I am walking on this path. Then we simple wwalk awake on it vs. sleep walking (i.e. autopilot). Eventually we might be awake and look around and see the bushes tnext to that path, maybe a wide patch of grass on the side we never noticed. Eventually one might simply wonder and walk into the taller grasses and maybe start cutting a new path.) Hopefully this imagery does not sound too \"new agy\" - it has helped me over the last 3 years to pick up on some of my thoughts patterns - now you'll argue (rightly) - I still went on Cipralex 5 months ago.... Indeed (I am self-employed - my biz. not moving forward as fast as I'd like - and I live in Canada so long winters which are making my mood condition worsen - while summertime it feels better - so I thought I'd try the Meds. see if my biz. + energy would get better - mood has been more stable in Cipra but energy not ideal - and just on 5 mg. So talked to my doctor and expressed the desire to get off it. She said \" A lot my patients want to get off it during summer.\" but you are on a baby dose so it is up to you she added. Also - I had stopped exercizing (due to a shoulder repetitive strain partly due to bad computer ergnomics - and I am typing right now... !!) Shoulder feeling better and planning to exercize again. My Doctor replied: \"If you can exercize more, this is a good anti-depressant.\" So here is my little 10 cents worth of exploring within and outside the Meds. to stabilize my mood (mainly depression.) We in the middle of summer... Ask me again when november comes around again But thx for sharing experience with side effects of getting off Cipra. I am going to go for massage or shiatsu - also more yoga and more cycling and swimming.

After being on anti-depressants for 4 years, Cipralex was the last one I was on and at a high dose. I was about to be switched to Effexor which scared me. I was also on a high dose of Ativan. I was losing my mind. I went cold turkey off all the medication. My husband suggested I try, since it had been 4 years. I asked my doctor and he looked at my husband and said something like \"good luck with the next couple weeks.\" It was hell. I slept a lot. Had vivid dreams, waking up in a pool of sweat. Extreme dizziness/vertigo. Nausea. Jackhammers in my head. Could not control my tears. I felt like a baby. I was an adult and had people babysitting me. It was irritating that a stupid little pill could technically take all the pain away but I wanted to be stronger than a pill. I actually spent the time I was awake reading Google results for Cipralex withdrawal like this; reading if other people were experiencing this. It helped a lot. I wasn't insane to be experiencing this! That was the first 2 weeks. The vertigo/dizziness tapered off along with the nausea, dreams, drowsiness and random crying. The headaches, extreme sensitivity, and anxiety took longer though. For the headaches I went off ALL medication including birth control. I found that the type I was on was intensify the headaches I was already having into migraines. It helped quite a bit for me to be completely med free. As for the the anxiety and sensitivity, that took months. Part of me thought maybe I was still depressed but I realized that when I was crying at things, it was to sad stories on the news, or sad parts in movies. I would cry my eyes out and this never happened before! But that was normal to other people. I had become so numb emotionally while on antidepressants. That's the point of them though! When you're depressed you can't control you emotions, you're either too high or too low, so the meds try to balance that. Your emotions become so dull after a long time. Where a movie where even men would be tearing up, I could sit through it thinking, \"meh ... could be sadder.\" Now I was crying at EVERYTHING sad. They showed a bunch of neglected animals at a shelter on the news and I couldn't stop crying. I thought maybe this meant I couldn't control my emotions = depression, but I was just experiencing emotion I hadn't for years! Granted it was being slightly enhanced by withdrawal. This might sound too hard but it took me 6 months to feel \"normal\". I had to basically re-learn emotions. I wasn't use to them. If your on the meds for a long time you kinda have to re-learn who you are in many ways. There are days where I feel depressed. I have to remember that Everyone, Everyone, has days like that though. I will probably always feel more susceptible to it as well. But I realize it. It's a bad day. Everyone has them. There's a good chance that that particular day I didn't eat that well or slept like poo the night before. I'm not stupid, I realize this isn't possible for everyone. I had a good environment to go med free in. My husband was EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE. That made things a lot easier for me. At the end of December this year, 2013, it will be 3 years I have been medication free. I was born and lived in Canada my whole life. Never thought I could leave cause of my meds. In May 2013 we moved to Japan. It's crazy but I haven't been this happy in my life! Sorry that this is long.

Thank God for this forum! I have been on and off anxiety/depression drugs for over 20 years (Prozac, Zoloft). Four years ago, I was put on Cipralex for drepression. It was like a wonder drug. No more anger, frustration, could focus, and no more mood swings. This year, I lost my job. I decided to wean myself off of the drug. I was on 25 mg, then tapered to 20, then 10 and finally 5 for the last 4 weeks. The last day was October 18th. Two weeks prior, I started getting these incredible dizzy spells that came on suddenly, coupled with nausea. After a few days, it went away but I still felt fatigue, aches and pains, tinnitis, and felt extremely cold and then extremely hot. Two days after the final pill, I got this debilitating dizzy spell again with the ringing in the ears and all the flu-like symptoms plus zapping when turning my head. I went to my family doctor today and he told me that I may have a brain tumor and wanted me to do a CT scan! I knew he was wrong but I didn't know what was wrong with me ... until I talked it over with my friend and we figured out it was because of me going off Cipralex! And then I found this forum. I thought I was losing my mind! I hear similar accounts posted here and I feel so relieved. I have almost all the symptoms. Instead of going back to my idiot family doctor who should've figured this out as he was the one tapering the meds, I would like to ask you guys a question. I am afraid he may have tapered me off the meds a tad too quickly. But, I guess that is a moot point at this time. Should I maybe go back to 5 mg for a couple of more weeks to continue the tapering off process or just suffer through it? So far, no psychological symptoms have reappeared, just physical ones. I'm assuming I can expect to be like this for at least a month, correct? Thank you so much for sharing your experiences. I don't feel so alone.

I feel now that I'm able to cope without the medication so have been tapering myself off. As of about two weeks ago I've only been taking one pill every other day and so far I can say I'm feeling good. I know two weeks is still relatively recent but overall there haven't been any really raunchy side effects. While on the medication, I became very, very lethargic. I could spend an entire weekend sitting on the couch not changing my clothes or showering. Considering before I went on medication I showered every day without fail, that was a noticeable change. I also gained a decent amount of weight, not necessarily as a reaction to the medication but because I just didn't care if what I ate was going to make me fat. It's great not to be bothered by anything but in that context, it's very, very bad. I ate anything and everything. I didn't have that anxiety-ridden voice in my head telling me not to eat like a pregnant hippo. I had a really hard time concentrating and remembering things while on Cipralex. My grades in school dropped, I couldn't remember from one day to the next what my boss had asked me to do or how I'd done things so needed to be re-trained several times. I just felt absent and disconnected from what I was doing. Like clockwork, about a week before I'd start my cycle while on Cipralex, I'd experience depersonalization coming in waves lasting about 15-20 seconds throughout the day. It's almost as if I was experience withdrawal symptoms while on Cipralex. I slept. ALL. THE TIME. I was tired almost constantly. I was used to being more than ok and awake with about 7 hours of sleep, but while on Cipralex, anything under about 9 or 10 was awful. I'd wake up around 11am every weekend morning and sleep my days away, which was not like me at all. I love how the medication mellowed me out and stopped me from stressing over the little things but more importantly, allowed me to not dwell in depression when it was at its worst. I'm looking forward to coming off of them completely and feeling like my old awake self again. So far the only real side effects I've noticed are headaches in the evenings, a bit of nausea throughout the day, and ever so often I will feel what I would describe as a brain zap but very, very mild. I would more likely describe it as a zap of lightheadedness. To all of you going through wicked withdrawal symptoms, I wish I could reach out and give you a big hug because you're all so strong.

Then it was tapered down to 10mg for few months, then 5 mg for a month or two and finally I decided that I was ready to stop it.

At first, I didn't feel any difference but recently, last 2-3 days..I'm feeling lightheaded especially if I get up too fast or move my head to right/left.

There are a lot of horror stories out there about the worst of the worst that can happen and I'm happy to say that this is not one of those cases, so it's definitely possible to come off Cipralex without watching your body and life fall apart in front of your eyes. I was on Cipralex for about a year and a half and came to the point where I wanted to be off of them. I'd gained a lot of weight and was just generally tired of how they made me feel; considering I didn't need them to \"support\" me emotionally anymore, I was more than happy to let them go. I didn't go the smart way of tapering off, one day I just decided to stop taking them and wait and see what happened. The first few days were normal. On the fourth day I started getting very mild \"brain zaps\" (although I'd describe them more as the feeling of a momentary gust of wind inside your head). They would only really happen after standing up too quickly or turning my head really fast, but overall they were nothing that bothered me too much. About a week and a half after stopping the dose, I had one day where I felt a bit sickly, dizzy and the \"brain wind\" was a bit strong, but after that, it was good. The wind significantly reduced after that and I never had a dizzy day again following that one day. The only side effect I notice now is that I do cry easier than usual but you know what, I'm actually ok with that. It's so nice to feel strong emotions again. It's been a long time since I haven't felt numbed out. And now, several weeks later, I feel better than I have in a long, long time. And I'm so glad. So for anyone worried about it, it is possible to come off of them with a good experience.","author":"BBopper","title":"Very little withdrawal","replyTo":"post1520913","postID":"post1784810","date":"20140131-00:00:00 -0500","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_676800.html"},{"content":"update : Finally done with withdrawal was not fun for me But much better than on, took almost a month of severe symptoms, life is better","author":"TRACKER420","replyTo":"post1520913","postID":"post1785297","date":"20140203-00:00:00 -0500","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_673642.html"},{"content":"I'm coming off Cipralex myself. I've relocated and don't have a doctor where I am now. Having had experience with anti-depressants with my ex-wife, I knew I couldn't go cold turkey. So I planned myself a long taper and it's working. Because the dosage of this drug is low, it's difficult to adjust easily. I was on 20mg a day so I decided to take 10mg out of my entire weekly dose, one weeks at a time. So week 1 & 2 was 20mg a day except Saturday when I took 10mg. Week 3 & 4 was 20mg a day except Wednesday and Saturday when I took 10mg. I'm down to 10mg a day now and will not be taking any on Saturday starting in two weeks. Although this seems like a ridiculously long taper, its working because I'm having zero withdrawal symptoms. I am having some mood swings but I don't attribute that to actual withdrawal, that's just reduced SSRI volume and I'm going to have to adjust again to being without the constant leveller. I can't imagine just chopping the dose in half for two weeks and then getting off of it two weeks later. I think a lot of people make that mistake with their anti-D's and then just end up going in a circle. Don't rush it.

My doctor told me there was no side effects for taking Cipralex, no addiction and no withdrawal! God, i am going to give her the url to this page. I feel better reading i am not alone.","author":"yogaQueen78","title":"Withdrawal from Cipralex","replyTo":"post1520913","postID":"post1801972","date":"20140423-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_690049.html"},{"content":"I just started taking cipralex, to help with a mental drug addiction. I didn't have any real bad depression or anything...maybe just minor...mostly due to cirumstances in life. but think I was maybe self medicating with other drugs... I took half of a 20mg dose to start, because of the side effects. but I felt really horrible and stopped for a couple days, then started again, taking the tiniest piece, probably 1mg. I kept taking this 1mg for about 5 days, and it was giving me bad anxiety and paranoia, so I stopped again. But it has been 5 days now, and it's still not gone away. I still have the anxiety, paranoia, lack of appetite, bad libido, and I'm feeling pretty depressed, more so than I've ever normally felt. What the heck is going on. How can such a small dose be causing me so much problems? When is this going to go away? How the hell is anyone supposed to start @ the recommended 10mg/day and stay on, when 1mg is killing me? For anyone thinking of starting SSRIs, they are no joke. I don't think doctors are very good at explaining the side effects of coming on/off them. They probably really shouldn't be touched unless very necessary. It could just be worse. Definitely don't start them if you have school, or work, or responsibilities. Probably should only be started if you can have some time off, or if you're already in a very very bad place and it can't get any worse. I know it works different on everyone, and for you there may be no side effects, and it could work miracles. But for me, it has really caused me trouble and I deeply regret taking them. My doctor failed to mention this possibility...","author":"JiminyCricket55","replyTo":"post1520913","postID":"post1805919","date":"20140513-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_214585.html"},{"content":"Hi Everyone! I've been on Cipralex for about 5 years, it has been a miracle drug for me. I was depressed and did not know it. My wife got me to a good psychiatrist, who determined I was clinically depressed. I started at 10mg and now am up to 20. ... and I feel great. I no longer have that dark place I would go to, especially in the mornings. I am in my 50's but feel like I am 18 again... very natural, normal... As a Flamenco musician, I was worried that I would lose my musical 'edge'. The psychiatrist said this would not be the case as for those who should be taking it, the drug really just helps your mind work normally. ... And he was right, I am playing better now etc. Certainly, there are side effects. The main one for me is decreased libido. This is irritating but not a big deal. I tried mixing in some Welbutrin, which helped the libido but made me feel too 'jumpy', so I stopped. Regarding withdrawal, the psychiatrist recommended I never go off. He said if you go off an antidepressant, and find you are depressed again, it is likely that taking the drug again will not work. So for any of you thinking of withdrawing, be careful and do your research. Actually, I just was reading about the author David Foster Wallace. I think he had a more serious situation than me, but when he went off his medication, things did not work out. He tried to get back on, and when the drug did not work again, he wound up hanging himself... Yikes! Anyway, this is serious stuff, as is life. I think the key is a good Psychiatrist if you can find one and/or doing lots of research...","author":"Cipralexfan","title":"Do your research before you decide to withdraw","replyTo":"post1520913","postID":"post1808113","date":"20140526-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_694426.html"},{"content":"I just started going off 20mg of Cipralex and boy everyone is right..........it is hell, but I decided that I would rather be drug free than be on this sh_t medication.

I'm on day 7 off Cipralex completely (still on 150mg WellButrin) and the head zaps, dreams and crying have been a bit worrisome, though nothing as bad as being on Cipralex. What I have noticed missing from almost all posts is the discussion of exercise and nutrition. I used to be into working out hardcore and eating quite well, life was good. I let that slip for more than a year, mix in my family history of depression and anxiety, and I found myself on Cipralex. I thought it was a miracle drug, until I started having all my natural highs and lows blunted completely. I turned to recreational drugs on weekends to feel something again, nothing that jeopardized my career or responsibilities, but enough that it was an issue. I stopped and I've resumed my exercise and nutrition routine and the benefits are greater and just as fast as any anti-depressant, with NO side effects. If this isn't something you have tried or considered, please do. If you can commit to 2-3 full weeks of honest effort to start, the reward will be worth it. I apologize for being preachy, i just wish the best for all and wanted to share the easiest and most natural form of anti-depressant.","author":"Burtze","replyTo":"post1520913","postID":"post1820930","date":"20140813-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_701999.html"},{"content":"I've been on Cipralex ,on and off for the last 4 years.The results have been all over the place but I started taking it again about 6 months ago consistently. I needed to refill my prescription one day but decided to not do it because I wanted to save money (it is really pricey without coverage). After only 2 days I started experiencing serious headaches, dizziness, and what I've now learned to be, \"brain zaps\". It really makes sleep at night hard to do. So I decided to refill my prescription today and have another go. Since I'm not confident in the results I get from cipralex I feel like I should get off of it, but since the side effects from withdrawal is so bad, I'm not sure how to go about it.","author":"rocky2733","replyTo":"post1520913","postID":"post1824328","date":"20140911-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_704115.html"},{"content":"I would advise anyone who is considering stopping Cipralex to have a plan before hand. I stopped taking it around 3 weeks ago cold turkey thinking it would be the best thing for my relationship because of the side effects. Boy was I wrong. Quite the opposite it ruined my relationship. My girlfriend of 4 months couldn't understand why all of a sudden I was irritable. Crying and overreacting to situations. In general just not being a very good person and neither did I until I found this forum. I tried to explain but to no avail and she broke up with me.
