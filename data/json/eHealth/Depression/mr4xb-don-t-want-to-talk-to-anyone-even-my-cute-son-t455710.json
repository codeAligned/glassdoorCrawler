It is possible that due to work, family or any other causes, you are highly stressed and anxious. You may also possibly have a anxiety or personality disorder or actually you might be depressed. To improve your life and have a proper outlook towards life, it is helpful if you seek a guidance from a external person either in your family or your friends. If you do not have such dependable people then consulting a psychologist or a psychiatrist and undergoing proper counselling will be very helpful to making the proper assessment of your issues. Once diagnosed proper treatment will help you find happiness and content. I hope this helps.","author":"Deepak Anvekar","replyTo":"post1861922","postID":"post1862285","date":"20150627-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/user_profile_322742.html"}],"URL":"http://ehealthforum.com/health/don-t-want-to-talk-to-anyone-even-my-cute-son-t455710.html"}
