Hardest question was the first one. It asks you to write a program that will allow the user to create lines, rectangles, circles, text, etc. And allow them to manipulate them independently (move them, resize them, etc.) Design an object model for this application. (How would you model the representation of the document in an object oriented language? What classes would you define? What methods would you have? What would your API look like?)   Answer Question The second question ask you to code the following about facebook: Direct friends of m are Level 1 friends. Friends of friends are level 2 friends.....and so on Print level 1 friends first. Then print level 2 friends....and so on   Answer Question The third and final question was the follow: Write an efficient function that returns the nth Fibonacci number (There are many ways to solve this problem. Please write the most efficient method possible). Each Fibonacci number is the sum of the last two. The first 10 are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55   1 Answer

this question is a bit difficult because of the limited time I was given to code it. Given a binary tree with fields- {pointer to left child,poiter to right child,next pointer}. Initially the next pointers are all NULL. Now fill all the next pointers in each node with pointer to the node which is immediately right to the node in the same level. The next pointer of rightmost node in a level shold be NULL. It can be done using level order traversal using a queue but the interviewer asked me to do it without using queue or any extra memmory and in O(n) time. Hint: The logic is to fill the next pointers in the (n+1) th level while trvelling in the n th level. I was asked to code it   Answer Question

I am not going to reveal the questions here. I had heard about the question that the first interviewer asked. It is an open-ended question. The interviewer qucikly became frustrated with the direction I was going and had to rein me in a little bit. I was frustrated about why then he asked such an open ended question. Anyway, his intentions were clear when he asked the follow-up which I found to be an interesting one. But unfortunately time was running out at that point and I quickly suggested some ways I would solve the problem. In hindsight, I realized this was an important question because Amazon had designed a product around it and uses it very heavily internally. The second interview was about the application of efficient data structures to solve a problem. I quickly arrived at the solution and coded it. There was more time left in the interview and we talked about problems arising in a distributed architecture setup. The third interviewer was nice and asked if I needed a restroom break. I gladly took his offer. This interview was also about the application of an efficient data structure. I initially proposed a multi-threaded solution to his problem. He asked a few follow-ups which I was able to answer. But he eventually asked me to give a single-threaded solution which required the realization of a need for an efficient data structure. I quickly realized that I needed a data structure to solve a problem, but he had to give me some hints to arrive at the right one which ironically was what I had proposed for the question asked by the second interviewer. The last interview was not very technical. The interviewer asked about what I did my current role, how I would handle stress, what to expect at Amazon etc., After the interview was over, he walked me out of the building and wished me good luck.   Answer Question
