2015-07-21 11:23:22.353,onsite at houston  there were 4 technical interviews in front of a whiteboard. good mix of questions. got a call back saying that the bar raiser thought i d be good for a management role so i did a phone interview for that but i had a very hard time understanding the interviewer because of his indian accent. i found a decent solution to the programming question in that interview but was told i was not going to be offered the management position but would be offered an sde position  the recruiter talked about compensation but would not mention a base salary  only total compensation package  which is fine  but i make my decisions on my known budget and if i can afford rent in the location. then i heard nothing for several days and was finally passed to another amazon recruiter. she said that i had a phone call with a team manager to see if it was a good fit  she specifically said it would not be technical that i had allready passed all that. the phone call started out with very bad feedback  the interviewer was using some software that made an echo of everything i said. it was very disorientating to be talking about my past projects but hear my voice repeat. he turned whatever it was off then then drilled into one project in particular in an area that i had said i didn t setup. then asked an algorithm question  which i found a medium level solution for. it was very adversarial feeling. very strange company that they state that hiring is there number one focus. i think not hiring is really there number one goal  because after that call the recruiter said she was confused by what happened as well and said she d try me with 2 more teams for a fit. it s been 4 days since she said that so i ve pretty much written them off. no one that i ve talked to seems to be a decision maker  if a company makes a verbal offer and says over and over that they want to hire you  why not just finalize it and figure out placement later. company seems great if you know what your getting into  but the hiring process seems convoluted.,they asked me software engineering questions and about my past experience. they provide prep material to study prior to the technical interviews so there were no surprises until i had the interview that was not supposed to be technical.   answer question

2015-05-26 23:48:51.253,the interviews at amazon were a complete waste of my time  the process wasn t enjoyable at all. had contact with multiple amazon recruiters over phone and email and it was very poorly run. some recruiters didn t get back to me  some did. the overall process was chaotic and you re treated like a number. after passing the phone interview i was invited on site. my takeaway is that amazon treats its potential employees like they are expendable and they re only interested if you can pass the technical part which is okay  but they also want to know if they can overwork you. i wouldn t apply to amazon unless you knew full well of amazon s work environment  and the interviews only validated amazon s terrible work environment and culture that i ve read about. the positive aspect is you ll be working with very smart individuals  but these same individuals may be difficult to work with especially with the cut throat environment amazon fosters.,lots of behavioral questions to see if you re willing to be worked to death  then the standard technical coding challenges.   1 answer

2015-06-05 10:23:30.797,the recruiter contacted me by email for this position to set up a phone technical interview. the technical interviewer was nice and polite but i think he was more nervous than i was. he was unwilling to engage in even a few sentences of small talk. the phone interview consisted of a few programming questions such as write an atoi function. write a function to find pairs of number that add up to a given value. two of the questions were java specific language concept questions  even though the job requirement was for c or java. one of which was  what is type erasure  one question was on my approach to general problem solving. and one programming style question. my impression was that the interviewer had the answers to the question in front of him but did not have any in depth understanding of the concepts. i felt that this might have been a training session for the interviewer. granted this also might be sour grapes because i did not get an offer.,signed an nda  pretty easy questions though. some oop  some basic knowledge of big o.   answer question

2014-10-23 17:57:30.92,i got an email out of the blue asking me if i wanted to fly to seattle and interview. i still don t know where they got my resume  but i assume it was from when i applied for a co op position a year before. i was excited to go  but from the very start i got the impression it was going to be tough. i got an email about a week beforehand with about 8 attachments containing literature about the company. i was informed that i would be doing a programming problem for most of the day  and i would have my choice of language  compiler  and os. when i arrived on campus  we were given visitor badges and told to wait until someone came to get us. i felt weird that the majority  at least 75   of interviewees were foreign students. it made me feel like i was out of my league. we were taken upstairs to a conference room where hr gave a speech about how great the company is. we were then assigned to a table  and given a laptop and packet describing the programming challenge. the challenge was supposed to be team based  with the people at your table   but it turned out to be more individual that i anticipated. the problem broke into three pieces  and each person picked a part to do. you didn t have to use the same language. the parts were basically independent  but i could see where sharing code between teammates could be helpful. we were given 6 hours to complete the task. after about half an hour  an engineer came to gauge our understanding of the problem  and clarified anything we didn t know. we then worked for about an hour  and an engineer pulled each of us out for a personal  interview . it was the least personal interview i have ever had. the engineer was all business  and we just talked about my approach to the problem. when i got back  i had about 4 more hours to complete the assignment. half an hour before the deadline  we were individually interviewed again. pretty much the same type of thing  just talked about my approach. the interviewers were always interested in efficiency. they asked questions like  how could you make this better faster   and  why did you use this data structure . i really got bit in the butt because i was forced to use c    instead of c  which i am much more familiar with . i was unfamiliar with the c   libraries  and i had to waist a lot of time looking at documentation. big tip  be very familiar with your language before you go  my solution was incomplete  and i knew this when i turned in. i was encouraged to write a readme file which explained my shortcomings  and any ideas i had to make the code more efficient. at the end of the interview  we had a group q a with a developer. i got the impression that this was a very stressful job with poor work life balance. i love the area  so if i had gotten an offer it would have been a tough decision weather i was willing to sacrifice a stressful job for my dream city.,questions are covered by a non disclosure agreement   answer question

2014-10-02 20:14:50.85,i was recruited via linkedin and invited to two rounds of phone interviews before being invited to an onsite interview in seattle. because i have signed a non disclosure agreement so i can reveal the actual question. however  both phone interviews last about 90 min each and both have about 30 min to cover your background and career interest  about 10 min for my questions and the rest are technical questions. technical questions aren t terribly difficult but you do have to brush up your college data structure. the real tricky part is you need to log in to an online whiteboard or you to demonstrate your coding solution. the whiteboard actually has a simplified ide that can compile most of the common programming language. the interviewer from my second phone interview doesn t care too much about the actual compilation but the one from the first is a bit more particular on that. so if you are expecting just pseudo coding you might be surprised. regarding the on site interview there are about five different sessions  each last about 50 minutes. all except one are one on one  the other have two interviewer. the questions can be divided into three categories 1  projects you have done before 2  behavioral questions and 3  technical questions. for category 1  they might concentrated on a certain project in your resume when going over your previous experience  so picking the right experience to prepare for interviewed will certainly help. there are plenty example online for category 2. for the technical questions  they are more or less the same as the phone interview  except you only need to do pseudo code. they are mildly challenging and it shouldn t be overly difficult as long as you are reasonably apt at problem solving. the part i dislike the most is one of the interview session is done over lunch  so the interviewer will take me out to lunch and at the same time asking me questions. the amazon facility in seattle are right in downtown so my interviewer are juggling between finding the restaurant in the middle of the city  deciding what to eat and interviewing me at the same time. even worse is a hobo came up to us on the street asking for a quarter for cup of coffee or something like that. so a lot of time the interviewer seemed to be lost in all these and i didn t feel like what i said had actually got through to him at time. contrary to other s experience  all my interviewers do give me sufficient time to ask questions and i don t feel i was being rushed. however  it doesn t seem like they have a particular position in mind for me to fill  rather they are trying to see if i can be fit into any of their need  so i don t really have a clear idea what position i am actually apply for and thus it is hard to ask sensible questions also they are very responsive throughout the entire interviewing process  most of the time they will get back to me within one day or two between each round.,required to write compile able code during phone interview  being interviewed over lunch   1 answer

2014-08-08 16:30:36.723,i was contacted by a recruiter via email to interview for a sde position during a hiring event in boston. i had an initial phone call with the recruiter  who put me in touch with a scheduler. the scheduler set me up for a phone interview  which was a live coding interview.   phone interview   there were a few questions about my resume  the one they had was four years out of date   but the majority of this interview was technical. the questions were pretty basic and focused on general algorithmic knowledge. i only remember the last task  which involved fibonacci sequence generation. there were several steps after this that involved optimizing the solution. once finished  the interviewer gave me a chance to ask questions about amazon. shortly after the phone interview  i was contacted by the team recruiter who informed me that they d like me to come in for an on site interview. i made a point to discuss my resume being four years out of date  but was told this would not be a problem. i was given a list of times and asked to pick a handful that worked best for me. once that was taken care of  i was given a rundown of the position  salary range  relocation package  benefits  etc.  onsite interview specifics were explained to me and the onsite was set to take place a couple weeks later.   onsite interview   a schedule was given to me a few days before the onsite interview that outlined who i d be interviewing with  name and title   and at what time. the format was 4 interviews at 45 minutes each  all in the same room  all technical in nature. i arrived early  and waited in the lobby for an interviewer to come meet me and take me to the interview room. once other candidates arrived  there weren t enough chairs for everyone in the lobby  so the receptionist had to run and get some office chairs from somewhere else in the building. after waiting for a short period  maybe 20 or so minutes   my first interviewer met me in the lobby  got me a visitor badge  and we headed over to the interview room. i won t get specific about the questions from the onsite interview  nda  more on that later   but i will say that they follow a basic template. first few questions are scripted behavioral questions  everything else is technical. i was required to write code for every interview  even those with managers.  all of the interviewers were explicitly  not  strict regarding syntax  with the exception of the bar raiser. i was also asked architectural and design questions. i got along well with everyone but the bar raiser  who succeeded in ruffling my feathers a bit. all of the interviews were completed with enough time for me to ask the interviewer questions except for the bar raiser  whose interview i didn t wrap up in time. every interviewer had my outdated resume and asked me about my experience listed. this meant i had to update each about the last 4 years of my professional life  which contained directly relevant experience.  after the final interview  i was escorted to the elevators after being told multiple times that i d hear back from someone within 3 days. overall  the campus felt very sterile and almost prison like. what i did see of the office was bland and unappealing  no art on the walls  nothing distinguishing peoples  desks  nothing to suggest that people even work there.  i was only ever offered water  and was at no point allowed to go anywhere without a direct escort. throughout the interviews i did not leave the room  but was asked in between interviews if i needed to use the restroom. i was required to sign an nda to complete the interview process  but at no point was told what it was i d actually be working on  despite me directly asking. i was told that even other teams within the company weren t privy to what was going on. as mentioned earlier  i was told that i d receive either an offer or rejection within 3 days. about a week passed  so i reached out to the recruiters to ask for an update. no response. it wasn t until almost a month after the onsite that i was sent a rejection. the email was pretty off putting because it was suggested that maybe a support or systems engineering position would be a better fit for me. i was already making a downward move title wise to the sde position  but the change of location and project focus were appealing enough to merit that.   overall   while every person i spoke with was personable and seemed intelligent  without coming off arrogant   the company bothered me. amazon seems to be devoid of a culture to the point of feeling robotic. the sterile office  scripted responses  failure to follow through on self appointed contact deadlines  general lack of input recognition  the mildly insulting rejection quip  and some frustrating logistical blunders  which i won t get into   all made me think that it s probably best i didn t receive an offer.,i ll respect the nda and not go into specifics. i will say that it involved graph traversal.   answer question

2014-07-04 19:57:43.07,had a few phone conversations with hr about specific positions and interests. one technical phone interview with coding on a shared google doc like website. flew me to seattle and put me up in a nice hotel. interviewed with six people back to back without pause for four or five hours. each interview was roughly the same  do some whiteboard coding  answer questions about your history. none of the whiteboard questions were riddles or tricks or things with one weird solution that you probably won t come to on your own. they were just mildly thorny problems where a decent solution involves a map or two and updating data in the proper order  decent and realistic stuff. read up on amazon s leadership principles. there is a lot of  behavioral interviewing  where you re asked about challenges you ve experienced and how you ve responded to them. i went in expecting general questions where they d analyze my answer to see if it exemplified specific leadership principles. in reality  the interviewers just straight up asked   tell me about a time where you  insert amazon leadership principal  . where amazon differed from other companies is that i was not given much opportunity to ask questions of the interviewers. they told me the project is secret and that most projects at amazon are treated as secrets  even to other employees within the company. it s a little weird not knowing 100  what you re signing up for. also  i didn t get a good feel for the culture of the team i d be joining. the whole process took just over a month  which is apparently faster than usual. i was fielding interviews and offers from other companies so continually pushed amazon to keep the process moving along.,No Question

2014-06-29 15:29:16.743,i didn t hear back from them for over month after i applied. so i contacted them by email to ask about the status of my application  and they replied by inviting me for an on site interview at their seattle campus. they didn t ask for a phone interview or talk to me before that. i thought that was weird  but cool nonetheless. as it turned out  there was a catch. the reason they don t do phone interviews is because the on site interviews are group interviews with about 50 other candidates. and damn they are difficult. they don t have time to do phone interviews  because they are doing it mass production style. amazon is growing at a very fast pace  and adding a lot of employees constantly  as well as replacing those who leave because of their high turn over rate. i guess they figured this is the only way that they can hire a lot of people  yet still ensure they are only getting top quality. i would have preferred if it was one on one interviews. even if i hadn t gotten an offer that way  i would have felt more respected. the interview day is comprised of one big programming project. we were given old low end bulky laptops with small screens  14 inch   to work on. we worked in groups of three. they constantly stressed that we were not competing with either our teammates or other groups  and that if we were all good  they would hire us all. given the fast rate at which amazon is growing  i believe that. i believe the programming project was too big and too time consuming for only about 5 6 hours. i think it favors people with a lot of programming experience rather than problem solving ability. someone who can crank out a lot of simple code quickly will outperform someone who can write a small amount of really difficult code. i don t think they are necessarily getting the best quality of candidates this way. this is an entry level position  and they shouldn t have interviews more suitable for seasoned software engineers. amazon admitted that they have a very frugal cost conscious company culture and this is a good thing. however  i don t like that they downplayed the frequency with which employees are on call  where they could be called in the middle of the night and have to wake up and fix a site reliability problem  albeit from their home. according to them  it was a few days every six months  but according to someone i know who worked at amazon  it is a few days every couple of weeks.,the programming project was too big and time consuming for completing in under 6 hours. it takes a lot of time to read and fully comprehend the long project writeup and the framework code we are supposed to build on  let alone code it  test it  and comment it.   answer question

2014-06-08 13:28:46.54,my resume was submitted through an employee referral and i was invited for an on site interview at the amazon campus in seattle for a group interview. there was no previous phone screening in my case. we were randomly distributed into 3 person teams and everyone was presented with 3 different problems. the amazon interviewers and current developers present there mentioned that the problems were simplified versions of real issues that amazon was dealing with. in our team we had to come to an agreement as to which interviewee would take on which problem. after that  you were pretty much on your own to solve the problem. each interviewee was given a laptop and there were a variety of programming languages and ides available and even an ubuntu vm. i chose java  netbeans  and windows. you should really choose what you are most comfortable with  don t try to improvise there. unlike white boards interviews  here you had to get an actual program working  pseudo code would not cut it. on the other hand  you had plenty of time to think about your solution  which is not really the case in other 1 on 1 interviews. common online resources were available  google  stackoverflow   you just were not allowed to access personal repositories  dropbox  etc . every two hours you would stop coding and would explain your thought process to an interviewer for about 30 minutes  analyzing your approach  your reasoning and what you could do to improve your solution. even if you have no time for a more carefully optimized solution  you should be able to explain in a detailed manner how you would proceed if you had more time and resources  like a database  and why. your data structure choices and how to use them was very important in order to provide a working source code solution. be ready to go through the cons of each decision and think about scalability. overall  this wasn t a hard interview at all.,there was nothing really unexpected or any unfair questions. i believe the interview was designed to emulate a normal day at amazon  with all the resources you would have available  being able to discuss your approach with a small team  distributing work and at the end taking on your own responsibility.   answer question

2014-09-29 17:53:09.503,i got contacted via linked in by a recruiter. the recruiter was always very nice and very helpful  the recruiting people gave me advises and told me what to expect in the interviews and what topics to study  it felt like they were kind of on my side and wanted to help me succeed in the interviews. i first got a phone technical interview that lasted about 30 minutes. they asked me some general data structures questions and then we used colabedit for coding  i just got one single coding problem to solve  they asked me to write function to efficiently look for all the phone numbers from a list a that were part of a list b  i solved it by using a hash table and my interviewer was happy with the solution . then i got a second phone interview. the second interview was very similar to the first one  i got some data structures and algorithms questions and then they gave me another coding problem to solve on colabedit  they asked me to write a function that would receive the root of a binary tree as input parameter and would restructure the tree so that the final result was the same tree but vertically mirrored. i wrote a function and my interviewer was happy with it. after the two phone interviews  they asked me to fly to seattle for the final round of interviews that last the whole day. they put me in a nice hotel and payed for all the expenses. i got 5 interviews in total  each one lasting about 1 hour. first onsite interview  they asked me general questions and asked me to describe some of my past projects  then asked me to design and code a cache system. they told me they didn t know the right answer and they just wanted to see what i would come up with  they participated in the design suggesting things and asking questions. second onsite interview  they asked me to create an algorithm to find all the strongly connected components of a graph  very though question in my opinion . lucky me i had studied some graphs theory and i was able to remember tarjan s algorithm to find strongly connected components. i reproduced the algorithm from what i remembered and i think i did it right  although some times the interviewers are more interested in seeing how you approach a problem rather than knowing the solution  so not sure if knowing the answer played against me . third onsite interview  one of the amazon guys took me out for lunch to a place neat place near amazon and we just chatted and towards the end of the interview he started asking me some behavioral questions. fourth onsite interview  on this one i interviewed with a pm and a leader from one of the amazon teams. the amazon team lead asked me to design an ecommers website. i think i struggled a little bit with this one because i was not prepared for architectural questions or designed  i kind of just focused on algorithms. fifth onsite interview  the last guy just asked me to write some easy code to perform some task that i forgot  but it was very easy. in all the 5 interviews they all asked me behavioral questions related to the amazon values  study the amazon values  this is extremely important for them . although i struggled in the third onsite interview  i really felt like my overall performance had been great and i thought i was going to get an offer  but at the end they didn t extend an offer. i asked for some feedback to know what areas i was weak to work on them but they told me that they cannot provide feedback because of their policies.,they asked me to create an algorithm to find all the strongly connected components of a graph.   1 answer

2014-03-06 20:09:53.11,i was initially contacted by a recruiter via linkedin. after an initial phone call to discuss my background and interests  went through 2 phone interviews. these include a detailed discussion on my experience and specifics on projects i worked on  be ready to explain what you did  how  and why you did it   as well as some coding. amazon seems very interested in understanding the complexity of your work and how versed you are in sharing those experiences. after these interviews  i was scheduled for an onsite interview at the seattle hq. amazon puts you in contact with a travel desk that arranges your flight and accommodations for you. feel confident in asking for flights airlines or other requests you may have  as they are friendly and will try to get what you ask for. amazon flies you a day before the interview and puts you on a very nice hotel 10 min away from the office. onsite interview day included five 1 1 interviews  including two development managers and three sdes  focusing on different areas. you are received by your recruiter and have a 30 min chat with him. you get some details on what to expect during the day  and the days after the interview. most interviewers will be writing notes while you chat  they ask if you re ok with it   i wonder if you say no  what happens   . questions include behavioral and technical  as well as coding on a whiteboard. interviewers are friendly and help you through the process   ask for what are you thinking and give you hints in case they see you getting stuck. the best way to easy the nerves is to keep talking as you tackle problems. it helps more than what you think. i heard back from my recruiter after 2 days saying the team wanted to move forward and extend an offer. a couple days after i got the details of it and after some light negotiation i accepted. my advise is to avoid focusing too much on the horror stories you find online  and just make the experience your own. it is unlikely you ll get something like you have read here. it will be unique and a good learning experience  whatever the outcome is. just try to enjoy it as much as you can and please  don t go into it without serious preparation before hand. even if you don t make it you want to give a good impression  and of course  avoid post interview  what if i have...  thoughts.,i cannot disclose specific questions due to nda. however  just get ready and feel comfortable with basic cs  algorithms  data structures  oo design . make sure you can cleanly write code for simple  well known problems  and that you can explain in few words these concepts.   answer question

2013-12-20 14:45:32.253,amazon attends the career fair at our university every semester and the have a couple of interview with a few selected candidates and if they pass they are invited to seattle. this time i instead got a email to take the programming challenge. a weeks time was given to submit the code. the challenge itself was for 2 hours. it had three questions and all you had to do is write the code  there is no compilation   explain it and also add relevant comments. the questions weren t extraordinarily tough or anything. if you have sound logic and a good grasp of data structures you should be okay. 2 weeks later i got an email to attend an onsite interview. the whole process of scheduling a onsite took almost a month. i ve heard that it usually doesn t take that long but they probably had many people interviewing. i flew out on a thursday and was accommodated in a nice hotel quite close to the headquarters. the interview was scheduled to begin at 12 00pm. i made my way to the office and after all of us who had interviews assembled  around 40  we were given temp ids and taken to a large room with many tables. they asked us to sit in groups of 4 at a table and grab a bite to eat. in a few minutes our interviewers came and joined and everyone had a nice informal chat. after half an hour  names of interviewers and and those people who they will interview were called out. we were taken to our respective rooms and the interview started. as is with many other reviews here  i am not at liberty to disclose what they asked me during the interview. but make sure that you have spent time sitting and writing code by hand on paper or better yet  on a whiteboard. cracking the coding interview was the only thing i referred to. solve the book yourself and towards the last chapters you ll realize that breaking down difficult problem comes naturally. i had four back to back interviews. all technical with quite a large amount of coding involved. there were a few random hr questions but mainly coding. there were 2 4 programming questions in each round. one has to explain the logic  write the code and explain his her logic  prove that the code works run test cases and be ready to tell him her them how you would scale that code up in case they ask you. there was no pre defined level to the order of difficulty  i found the first three equally intensive and the fourth one very hard. more stress cannot be laid on the following fact    strict proper coding is of paramount importance . just scribbling stuff  writing algorithms will not help you. you are expected to know your stuff. proper function definitons  variable names  pointer usage  if c c   . when you test your function make sure that you have thought about every single edge case under the sun. you might think that you have covered them all but beware. if i say every possibilty under the sun  i mean under the sun not only on earth but also under the sun on jupiter  saturn  moon etc. i got stuck at a point where i didn t even have a single line of code on the board. the interviewer did give me a hint after a couple of requests. but be sure that you have thought out  aloud  every other possibility. there is no greater sin that not knowing what space and time complexities are and how to figure out what they are for the algorithm you have come up with. we were done by 5 in the evening on a friday and i had the offer on monday. good luck to anyone reading this ,worry about recursion and different types of trees.   answer question

2013-05-25 19:02:53.533,i applied online and was contacted by a university recruiter. i had to do a small programming test online  about 90 minutes . it was simple  and you could do your programming in java or c  . with this online assessment was the usual personality test that comes with job applications. i did not have a phone interview and was invited in about a month later for what i call  interview day . since i live in seattle  they didn t offer to put me up anywhere  but i know they will fly you out to seattle and set you up in a hotel as part of the process. interview day is essentially a series of 4 5 interviews  each lasting about 45 minutes. about 10 minutes consists of talking about what they do and asking you about yourself. the remaining time is spent answering technical algorithm questions. while i am not allowed to discuss the questions they asked in detail due to a non disclosure agreement  my best advice would be to know your algorithms. if you re in school  i highly recommend taking a high division  400 level or equivalent  algorithms course  as it was exceedingly helpful to me. two of the questions i was asked were questions i had been asked inside that course. know time and space complexity  dynamic programming  and recursive programming inside and out. as long as you know your stuff  that means study   you will do great. also  i feel like half of the interview is about culture. they are trying to test your knowledge and determine if you fit in with the culture of amazon. what i mean by this is  1. be yourself. don t suck up. this doesn t mean be rude or don t be polite to your interviewers  this just means you don t have to go with a  yes  sir no  sir  attitude. 2. don t wear a suit. they don t do that at amazon. wear jeans. don t worry about shaving your beard off for the interview. 3. talk to them about what they do. they are programmers too. if you express interest  and hopefully some prior knowledge in their area of work  that will probably stick with them when decision time rolls around. so  in short  know your stuff  be yourself  and be calm. the interviewers are programmers too  they re not scary. my interview was on a friday  and i was offered the job the following monday.,i am unable to give details  due to a non disclosure agreement.   1 answer

2013-01-16 18:43:02.69,i applied online and got contacted roughly 2 weeks later. the first interview was a technical interview in which i was asked one question to implement a function that required recursion. i was a bit rusty on recursion so i struggled with it  but the interviewer gave me tips and was helpful and i eventually got the solution. i thought due to my struggles that i would simply be brushed off from that point. however  i was surprised to see that i passed and moved on to the next stage. the second interview was two weeks later  in which the interviewer didn t call and it had to be rescheduled. at the rescheduled interviewed  the interviewer had a thick accent and explained the function that she wanted me to code. throughout the interview her tone of voice generally sounded depressed or bored and she didn t really offer any positive acknowledgements like the first interviewer. i finished the function but got it wrong since i mistaken what she wanted probably due to her accent  but quickly fixed it to be what it was supposed to be within 30 seconds. i found out a week later that they re going to pursue other candidates. overall  the first interviewer was clean  concise  and helpful in what he wanted me to do  even though i struggled i passed the first phase. the second interviewer seemed as though she wasn t as organized  missed first scheduled interview  really did not explain the question clearly   the first interviewer copy pasted an exact description of the function   examples  whereas she manually typed in some examples while trying to explain it   and clearly was not excited or enthused about her job  or maybe the interviewing portion of it .,mainly questions about array manipulation.   answer question

2012-03-14 22:18:26.39,the interview process consisted of two phone interviews. each phone interview lasted about 45 minutes and include about 20 minutes spent coding in a chat room. the first interview began by asking me to describe my background for a few minutes. then there were questions about basic object oriented programming concepts. then they ask about concepts specific to whatever language you re most comfortable with. then they asked about concepts dealing with a secondary programming language. then they ask about data structures. then they asked me to design an algorithm dealing with a particular data structure and to analyze the time complexity of the algorithm. then i had to code the algorithm. the second interview was very similar to the first  except it was quite a bit more difficult because the interviewer wasn t as helpful in guiding me using the coding portion of the interview.,what is the average case and worst case time complexity for mergesort    1 answer what is the average case and worst case time complexity for quicksort    1 answer
2011-12-09 08:04:49.097,i had the interview with amazon yesterday so still waiting to hear back about a second interview. the interviewer was very friendly and accommodating  i had bad phone signal  and we started off easy with him asking me all about previous positions on my resume. he wanted to know what projects i was proud of and which ones were most difficult. we then moved into talking about common scenarios you might encounter as a developer such as finding areas of code which are slow and how to fix them. he wanted to know details of the debugging process starting from when a manager comes to you and says  this page is too slow  for example. after that he wanted me to design a class structure for a furniture factory. there was already a simple  but flawed  structure in place and i was asked to improve it based upon various upgrades they wanted to implement. if you know your oo you ll be fine  it was mostly common sense stuff. it ended up with the data structure algorithm question which i was asked to describe in detail then code using an online collaboration tool so he could see me typing. the problem was writing an algorithm to detect when two linked lists intersect. the key i think is to keep talking and make sure you are explaining what you re thinking. he wanted me to improve the initial design and so i did and he accepted it as a good solution. we then talked a bit about amazon  seattle and what i d be working on if i got the job. overall i think it went well and as long as you re up on details on your resume  oo and data structures you should be ok.,write an algorithm to determine if 2 linked lists intersect   14 answers

2011-11-27 20:14:28.987,the interview had all of the normal formalities. some friendly chat  a lunch  talk about the area and the policies at amazon. interview questions were almost exclusively about working with high performance data structures   hashes  maps  tables  trees and the like. all questions inevitably led to  how would you do it faster   which really meant  how would you make it more scalable . being able to solve the problem in o n  time or better is key. in short  be adept with the standard data structures and using them optimally. it involved writing almost all of the functions on a whiteboard. heuristics were brushed upon briefly  only to lead to  okay  now that you ve done that   how would you do it faster  . there weren t any questions about working with others  design processes  maintainability  past experience. they showed no interest in any portfolio content. they were happy to answer questions about what it s like to work there  but i detected some dishonesty about it   it was not as good as they made it sound. individuals and teams are  on call  24 7 for any bugs that are found in their code. other sites cite amazon for poor home work balance. managers didn t seem to understand their leadership role. while the newer projects and cutting edge algorithms designs obviously excited the engineers  it seemed like there was a lot of tension. conversely  the workplace was riddled with fun posters  decor  sticky notes  nerf guns and dogs. i feel i did relatively well in the interview   i was able to clarify their deliberately vague requests and produce a quick sample algorithm  and then refine it to what i believed to be optimal  which came out to o 1  or o n  in my cases . i was honest that i had not sought to work for them  they found me   that i needed to consider seattle a bit more before moving  and that i had little experience in working on large server database applications. i probably gave off a lot of enthusiasm for areas of software that are of little interest to amazon. they contacted me back and said they were not interested in continuing. neither was i.,you have a sentence that has a grammatical error  and the sentence has been broken into a parse tree. the grammatical error is because of an interaction between two words. find the minimum complete phrase that includes the grammatical error.   2 answers

2010-02-28 22:49:14.333,i had a phone interview with amazon. i was referred by a friend from mitbbs  and was contacted by a recruiter about one week after the referral. we set up a time for the first phone interview. the recruiter was responsive and nice  and the only weird thing was that she mentioned she would send me some application forms but she never did. i didn t quite have a real expectation to get an offer from amazon. for the first phone interview  i was surprised that the interviewer called 3hours earlier than i expected  but it turned out to be my mistake    i didn t pat attention to the time zone. even though i was caught by a surprise  the first phone interview was just a piece of a cake for me  the coding problem was simply deleting some numbers in an array. after that there was an even simpler classic problem  in an array  all numbers appear twice except one special number  how to find that number. i told the interviewer with honesty that i knew the problem and he moved on to the next. the next and also last problem was asking  if you have two eggs  n floors  how to find the critical floor number below which all eggs dropped will not break  and above which all eggs dropped will break. by the way  their interviewers are really really nice. i was informed about passing the first interview only two days later. i had the second interview about two weeks later during travel. i was not fully prepared but i was much less nervous than the first time  as i was getting very close to my dream offer from another company. the interviewer called  and started with asking me why i want to be a software engineer. then he asked me about some knowledge and concepts of hashing  which i was quite familiar with. after that was the coding question  which was sent to me as an email. after reading the problem and explaining my approach to the interviewer  he decided not to have me write the code  i still couldn t figure out why  since clearly the title of the email said  coding question . maybe i left him an impression that my coding skills were so strong that he didn t even need to see it  but i never demonstrated any of my coding skills to him. the last problem was ood  as expected from amazon s interview. i was relatively weak in this area  but i managed to grab some key words and key ideas which made him somewhat content. i was notified about the result a couple of days later  and i was told by the recruiter that i did very well in my phone interviews  although i personally doubt it...,explain what is hashing and how does hashing works   1 answer all numbers appear twice in an array  except one special number that only apprears once. how to find it efficiently using only constant extra space   1 answer

2009-12-17 11:21:42.587,my resume was submitted via a friend to an internal recruiter with amazon.com. the resume was then picked up by a department seeking an sde. the department s recruiter contacted me via email to set up a phone interview  which was scheduled in short order. at the appointed time  i received a call from the interviewer who turned out to be a sde in the department  as opposed to the hiring manager . she provided me an overview of the responsibilities of her team and then asked me to say a little about myself  which i did. then the interview got technical. she asked me a data structures selection algorithm question followed by an object question. after i was done with those  i had an opportunity to ask questions  which i did. the entire interview took an hour. while i get that amazon.com deals with large quantities of data and efficient evaluation of that data is necessary  i think they may be eliminating very good candidates with excellent capacity to learn  like myself  of course  by asking for answers to questions that the code is already written for. this is a commentary  of course on the data structure algorithm question. object design is a more obvious way to see how i think and approach problem solving.,what are the first 2 integers that  when added together  equal 10 in a  very large  array of unsigned integers    6 answers

2015-03-20 00:27:54.87,i usually don t write reviews but since i used glass door a lot  i wanted to give back some. so i interviewed for an australian position. i first went through 2 phone screens which included coding and behaviour and technical behavioural questions  eg. what is clean code  . the emphasis was on getting the coding correct and less on the behavioural stuff but be prepared for those type of questions like  when was a challenging time you had at work  how do you deal with tight deadlines etc... the second phone interview coding question is a bit harder than the first phone interview. i then got scheduled in for an on site interview at the australian office but predominantly it was done through vc link to seattle hq. due to the time zone difference  initially my interview would start at 8am  5 interviews then lunch break then final interview. a total of 6 interviews  5 of them are 45mins  1 of them only 30 mins. this interview was setup 3 weeks in advance but 36 hours before the interview  i get an email from amazon hr that the schedule has changed and that it will be 6 interviews in a row. so do the maths  that s 4 hours and 15 mins straight. you don t need to be a rocket scientist to figure out 6 interviews in a row is going to mentally drain you...to death. i was set up. they knew this was going to happen as the change was due to an australian manager being in the us. i m sure they knew this well in advance. even other australians didn t get this treatment. this severely tested my mental endurance. ok   i had a bathroom break in the middle and got some water but that was it. i was doing really well until the last 10 minutes of the 4th interview where i couldn t fix a bug in my program. i was brain dead and stressed. overall the people i interviewed with were nice  but some came across as unbelievably arrogant. to you young ones out there  i am 30 years old and have worked for 8 years as a professional software engineer at major companies. these are very much red flags of how the company treats people  at a system level and also at a personal level. i ve been around long enough to see and smell poison when it comes. nice on the surface  but fundamentally don t care about you. just do some research on amazon s poor attrition rates and work culture. money only means so much. do some research in how many job advertisements there are for amazon sdes over the last 3 4 years  there s a zillion. you re going to be a cog in a machine. the amazon formal processed hiring bar is quite high but it is selectively applied to certain positions. but not everyone gets in this way. i personally know people who got in by references at amazon  google and facebook. my point here is that they re all still human  just like you and me. don t let the high bar intimidate you. i m writing this review not necessarily to get you in but to help you see companies for what they are. if you want in   ok great  but your choice. if it s your first tech job  then go for it. most importantly  ask yourself this question  do really want to work for ecommerce websites  insert job here  or are you interested in amazon because of their brand name high salary  do you know amazon has both boring and interesting tech jobs  how important is this to you  how does this affect your future career path  what is your purpose in life  is it related to your career  consider work life balance etc... long story  i couldn t start in the time they wanted me  i was at least 4 5 months delayed  to so they didn t offer me at the time and said will coordinate further down the track. did i get rejected  probably. in the mean time  i got a very good job offer with very very interesting work form another reputable company. after amazon s interview  the hardest i ve ever done  this other company s was relatively easier. even if you don t succeed  the interview process will train you for the future but learn from your mistakes. trust god and have confidence in yourself. god bless,1st phone screen  technical behavioural questions   2 fairly mediocre coding questions 2nd. phone screen technical behavioural questions   1 fairly substantial coding question on site interview 1st interview  coding questions about arrays and reading a file into memory 2nd interview  white board diagram design. distributed systems architecture 3rd  behavioural admin  wishy washy behavioural questions   talked about signing bonus  start date  and stock 4th. coding questions  object orientated class design. 5th. technical behavioural 6th  coding  hardest coding question of the day   answer question

2014-11-25 18:26:09.063,i applied on the web responding to an offer and providing a resume. i was contacted the day after  really  and asked to have an online programming test. i had 7 days to do it but i did it right after receiving the email. the test was of 2 hours and consisted in three problems  two of them were pretty easy and i found the last one much harder. the email explained that the code will be reviewed manually by amazon engineers. less than a week later  i was invited to set a date for a phone interview. we set it for two weeks later. the interview was 90  technical and included basic data structure knowledge and complexity. there also had a conception question and a problem solving. nothing too complicated for a serious candidate. they mailed me back a week later  a friday  to invite me to join an assesment day the next thursday. i went to it  it consisted in a day starting with a short introduction to the different teams and the challenge they had to face. we were 8 to this assesment day  4 such days were organized and we were told they had 6 vacancies. after the presentation  i had 4 face to face interviews each of 45 min   1h  with a nice sandwich pause between the second and the third interview. almost all interviews included question based on the experience   tell me a time when ...  . they dig into your example quite far  so come up with real and interesting examples. the second interview only consisted in a programming session which i found very easy compared to the other technical questions. of course  all interviews were mainly technical. the first one was about generalities and were pretty easy. i found the third and the fourth much more difficult. the third one included a long conception question and a problem solving question. finally  the last one was only a problem solving question  a problem that the team had actually had to handle  probably simplified  that we discussed very deeply. these are the only interviews where i was not able to provide what i thought to be the best answer  since i came up with better ideas soon after the interviewers left the room. for problem solving question  especially the last one  they don t seem to be interested in seeing you solve that all  but rather detect all the difficulties and propose a na ve solution  but being aware of that and explaining what should be improved and how  if you have any idea .,the design you proposed me seems fine to me  it will probably work. though  let s imagine that someone comes to you saying he dislikes it and ask you to change it. what do you do     1 answer
2014-10-24 05:15:17.417,i applied through the amazon careers website and was invited to a first 45 minute telephone interview just over two weeks later. the invitation suggested that there could be an emphasis on soft skills but the interview was entirely technical. i spoke with a more junior engineer from the team to which i was applying. after some small talk  i was asked three relatively simple technical questions to be solved in a collabedit environment. the interview ran for slightly more than 1 hour. i heard back the same day that i would go through to a second telephone interview  this time with a more senior engineer on the same team. the interview was set for six days later. there was less small talk in this second interview  which went straight into technical questions. i was asked to work on one problem  again in collabedit. the interviewer said at the end of the interview that they had wanted to ask follow up questions but there wasn t enough time  since they were sticking to the 45 minute window. i heard back two days later that i would not be invited in for the face to face interview. while all the interactions up to the rejection were of a quite relaxed nature  the rejection letter was quite formal.,i would rather not give away specifics but i will say that all the questions i was asked were relatively straightforward and based on searching and sorting integer arrays and tree data structures. there were some follow up questions on time space complexity as well.   1 answer

2014-10-27 18:07:29.78,first contact was at a job fair. answered some basic object oriented programming questions. a few days later i was contacted by e mail to schedule first phone interview. first phone interview were general questions about my r sum   as well as a brief explanation of the software development position i was interviewing for and some additional technical questions about data structures. contacted again to schedule a second phone interview. the second phone interview was of a more technical nature. first question was about the implementation of a phone book and how to handle misspellings  i.e. how to also return slight variations of a query. second question was to describe how i would implement a function that determines whether 2 elements of an integer array will sum up to a certain target value. i proposed a na ve solution first  in o n     but was asked to also give a possible solution that is in o n . both interviewers told me that the phone interviews are scheduled in such a way that there remains time at the end for the interviewee to ask question. however  as the whole process seemed pretty clear to me  i didn t have any specific questions. this might have been the reason why amazon chose to not take my application to the next step.,what is a weak reference in java    answer question

2014-11-05 14:24:58.553,was referred by a friend. accepted to do a 2 hour online assessment that involved 2 coding questions followed by logical questions. did the assessment without using outside sources because they monitored your browsing activity  did screen capturing and you had to be on webcam the whole time. after completing that assessment the following survey asked what online sources i used to aid me. since they didn t specify that i was able to use online sources i didn t use any making it way harder than it should have been. felt very uncomfortable in the way that they monitored me scaring me from using online sources. overall non human interaction i feel is a bad way to weed people out. felt a lot of anxiety doing the test due to being monitored so strictly. probably would of done better if they specified before hand that you are able to use online resources to help you,unable to comment on questions due to the agreement that questions are personal property of amazon.   answer question

2013-12-21 07:42:08.093,this is my experience during the campus selection drive of amazon.com. the process started with a brief presentation by the recruitment team. the process had 5 stages. the first test was online  having 20 objective questions from various topics and 2 questions to code. one required a complete code  the other required coding a method for the specified purpose. this was followed by four technical interviews. each interviewer constantly typed on their laptop while interviewing us  probably making a note about us. we had to think of a solution for the given problem and optimize the same. this was a  white board  test  which required us to write actual code for the solution. the questions were pretty tough  but were manageable. the interviewers were very friendly and were very open about their work culture.,the most difficult questions were from data structure implementation point of view. they required a strong understanding of the problem statement to decide the correct data structure to implement. they were very stern about the required efficiency of the solution. getting a solution wasn t enough  we are expected to give the best solution we can possibly think of    answer question

2014-03-17 12:32:11.47,i am interviewed as part of on campus recruitment process.i am a student of nit waranagl. this review therefore is in the context of on campus placement. there was an online aptitude test followed by technical interviews. there were four technical interviews . in the first technical interview i was asked to find the pivot element in a sorted and rotated array. o n  solution is obvious and i gave him o log n  solution   binary search  and i was asked to code it.after writing the code i was asked to check my code if it covers all the edge cases or not. i have tested it and it seemed to work for all the edge cases but the interviwer pointed out a case where my code fails and then i have corrected it.he also asked me to write the code for searching an element in the sorted rotated array using binary search. the second question is given a binary search tree  replace each node with the sum of numbers greater than the number in the node.i gave him o n  solution and he was satisfied with it. in the second round   i was asked to design an application that sends a message to two friends if they come within two miles of each other. i gave him a solution indicating the data structures used to maintain the friend list and model of the solution . he pointed out the cons of the solution and i modified the data structure.then there was long discussion where i gave him different solutions and he pointed out the cons of each solution and asked me to overcome it.finally i arrived at a solution and the interviewer was satisfied with it. he also asked me a couple of puzzles and i answered them. i think the third round was the bar raiser i was asked two questions. the first question was   given n jars each having a colour of some value.the value of the colour is from 0 to 100. when two jars  with colours say  a  and  b  are combined  the colour of the resulting solution is  a b  100.also  a  b  amount of gas is released .find a way to combine all the jars to form a single jar with minimum amount of gas release. only adjacent jars can be combined . the problem is similar to matrix chain multiplication  o n 3  dynammic programming and after i gave him the solution i coded it. the second question was  a quadra tree is a tree where each node has atmost 4 child nodes. similar to a binary tree which has atmost 2 child nodes . a monitor screen  black and white  is represented by a qudra tree in the following way  case 1 if the entire screen is white then the value in the root node is white. similarly if the entire screen is black then the root stores black. case 2 if the screen is neigther completely black nor white then the screen is divided into 4 quadrents. and the node has 4 child nodes each representing one of the quadrants.  the screen is recursively divided into subscreens . now given two screens represented by two quadra trees  return a quadra tree which represents the overlapping of the two screens.  assume when white and white overlaps results in white black and white overlap results in black   black and black overlap results in black . i was asked to write the code for it. round 4  q1  implement a stack which supports pop min  return minimum element in the stack in o 1    along with push and pop operations. i gave him a couple of solutions and i was asked to code them.the he gave me a solution  maintain a linked list of minimums in the stack  and asked me to code it. q2  given a binary tree with fields   pointer to left child poiter to right child next pointer . initially the next pointers are all null. now fill all the next pointers in each node with pointer to the node which is immediately right to the node in the same level. the next pointer of rightmost node in a level shold be null. it can be done using level order traversal using a queue but the interviewer asked me to do it without using queue or any extra memmory and in o n  time. hint  the logic is to fill the next pointers in the  n 1  th level while trvelling in the n th level. i was asked to code it. personal interview  hr  there was no hr interview although i was asked some questions like  why do you want to join amazon  future plans   tell me about yourself your habits and interests and about why i didn t do an intern ..etc summary of experiences the amazon interview process is very cool.the main thing here is to stay focused since the whole process is time consuming. the interviewers were very friendly and they are not bothered about the formalities.so the experience was great.,this question is a bit difficult because of the limited time i was given to code it. given a binary tree with fields   pointer to left child poiter to right child next pointer . initially the next pointers are all null. now fill all the next pointers in each node with pointer to the node which is immediately right to the node in the same level. the next pointer of rightmost node in a level shold be null. it can be done using level order traversal using a queue but the interviewer asked me to do it without using queue or any extra memmory and in o n  time. hint  the logic is to fill the next pointers in the  n 1  th level while trvelling in the n th level. i was asked to code it   answer question

2013-06-11 21:02:15.927,applied online and got a call from the hr for 1 1 interviews on a saturday interview rounds were on problem solving  algorithms  data structures  coding there was no phone screen written test. first 2 rounds were at similar level  later got to know that sde 1s took these interviews   candidate was called for further rounds  if at least 1 round was  meets amazon standards  and another  not sure . if any of these interviews went bad  candidates were eliminated immediately. these interviews were 1 hour each  mainly focusing on data structures and coding. third was hiring manager round  where in both technical and hr questions are asked. this round spanned for 1.5 hours  varied questions were asked. approach is checked  and time was given for difficult questions  fourth was culture fit round  1 hour   interviewer was late and apologized twice for the same. this round was to check if one is right fit for the role at amazon. this round surprisingly had a data structure question. then  on current project  challenging situation  why should we hire  etc. fifth was another technical round  this time with senior interviewer  sde 2 or sde 3   again for problem solving  algorithms  data structures and coding. there was a puzzle to solve at the end. feed backs after interview rounds were prompt and regular. i was informed that i was selected the next day after last round. the offer letter was dispatched in another 4 days. all interviews took place at amazon office in wtc building  except first round  where interviewer started off with questions straight away  all other interviewers were friendly. in general  i felt interviewers very smart and also work environment seemed good. ps  good lunch was provided for the candidates who had to wait for second round    ,given a n  large number  lists of customers who visited n webpages on n  large number  days  design a data structure to get customers who have visited the website on exactly  k  days and should have visited at least  m  distinct pages altogether. was then asked to improvise the solution as much as possible   answer question
2013-06-17 09:53:47.86,i applied about one month ago. then after two weeks  i got an email from recruiter in amazon asking me to do an online assessment in 6 days. i ve done it last night. the questions are relatively simple  people who have gone through data structures can solve it without too much thinking. it was 3 questions in up to 90 minutes. the hard part is for each question  i have to write down description of approach  assumptions  which data structures used and why  analysis on complexity  and code comments. it took me more than 10 minutes to get these documents done  one can easily tell i am not native speaker btw     there was another session for behavior test after finished 3 questions. things about whether you think you are creative  or what will you do if you find a minor bug near deadline. all self selection questions. i just finished the first round. long before i get a position. since i have to select whether get offer or not. better to select a yes for good luck    wondering if i can update later,writing documentation for 3 test questions took me a big way too long time.   answer question
2013-05-13 14:33:12.027,ok  i think everybody knows an average process of amazon s interview. so i want to write something that i didn t find usually in reviews.. how to prepare   rest well before interview. be in a good mood. smile  smile all the time    read book  cracking coding interview . i didn t have any single question from there  but this book has 2 huge pros   it helps you to understand how your interview will look like and how to prepare to it  yes  this first  smallest part of book helped me a lot  i never had such interviews before   and it could help you remember basic stuffs about algorithms etc  especially if you graduated more than 5 years ago .   they will send you a list of questions to prepare. pass whole list  use wikipedia at least  jump between links  etc.   it will also help you   prepare your own questions for them. be personal  ask exactly what you want to know  maybe  you will not have another chance to ask such questions   sleep well for at least one week before   don t drink alcohol for at least 3 days before   eat well before. approx.   in 1 1.5 hours before. eat something that you like  and something that is good for sure      be there in 15 30 minutes before scheduled time on interview   talk out loud  talk out all the time  talk out all stupid stuffs that you have in your mind  most probably  they don t care how much you know  they should care   how much you can  invent   so  if you don t know some famous algorithm  but you can  invent  it just on interview  of course  with mistakes    it s much  much better      be honest. don t try to cheat. if you know exact answer to exact question   talk out loud first    i know an answer. i just read about it yesterday . and then  if your interviewer will say you  go on    answer on it. first of all   they will know that you re honest person  and they can trust you. again   it doesn t matter in general   how much you know  it matters more   how much you can invent  because in amazon you will solve problems that probably nobody solve before..   amazing quote from book  cracking coding interview    despite the questions onpolymorphism and heaps and virtual machines  the question interviewers really want an answer to is   would i have a beer with this guy  ... so   smile  be honest  be yourself     your future teammates  most probably  your interviewer is one of them  want to be sure that they can rely on you. that you can work yourself    another quote from the same book. so   prove them that you can work yourself    don t answer immediately  think a little before. but think aloud  be sure that your interviewer knows that you re thinking and not answering      if you find a mistake in your answer  even in question that you answered 10 minutes ago    don t be afraid to fix it   if you have any question   ask it  it could change your answer really a lot..  one guy answered to 10 my specifying questions    i don t know .. and it was actually right answers    but usually you will receive a lot of information    yeah  i messed all the time. i did errros. i did one huge error  most stupid error in my last few years. but   i talked out loud  i talked all the time  i talked about what i think about it etc. so  again   talk out loud  this is your mantra for interview   if you see how you can optimize your solution   optimize it  optimize it all the time. and talk out loud why you think it s better  don t be afraid to change you code. but be sure that you will finish your task in time    stand out from the  crowd . be different. of course  probably you should not paint you hair in blue color    but be sure that you are not like  everyone . you should be  a little different . they should remember you   ask about requirements for code. they could be different   maybe  much more loose than you think  e.g.  when i said that my solution will be non optimal  one guy said that he need ..a.. solution. my solution was horrible  but i  delivered  it. just in last seconds of our interview. he looked very happy...  after interview have a beer  you deserve it.,no difficult question. the interview walks you through the answer and helps along the way. just be good at algorithms and some languages like c     java  etc.   answer question

2012-10-31 20:26:35.27,applied online via third party site  received an email later that day to setup a phone interview. the first attempt at an interview  saturday  didn t happen because my interviewer had to leave early. one thing to note was that  i asked the hr person who was going to interview me and it changed on the day  so don t be surprised if that happens. i was able to reschedule the week after. my interviewer was again with a different person then i expected and we had trouble with the phone lines so we couldn t hear each other that well. because of that he skimmed past questions about my experience and went straight to coding. i understand given the circumstances it was probably the best option but because of that i wasn t able to build a rapport with my interviewer and that put me off my game a little. i am however not making excuses  you ve got to work with what you ve got. i was asked 2 tech questions  not particularly difficult but also not particularly obvious  well for me that is. i believe after a bit of figuring out and some help from him i was just about to finish the first question but the collabeit site kept erroring so we had to stop the interview. having not completed either question  he then throw me a bone and said  email the answers within 2 hours. i was able to answer  1 but  2 had me stumped  the actually question he asked was relatively simple  the parameters in which i could answer it however  was not in a way i was accustomed to. needless to say i couldn t answer the second question and didn t have enough time to document my thought process in my different attempts to find solution. i pretty much knew i wasn t going to be considered for a face to face interview  so after a week went by with no communications i emailed the hr lady asking if i was still in consideration  which i knew i wasn t  she told me that were still reviewing my interview feedback. the day after i was officially declined.,like i said the questions weren t difficult but the way i could answer them were something i wasn t use to   answer question

2012-10-29 19:20:27.063,i applied to this position a while before i got contacted to set up a phone interview. even though i had already gotten and started a job by that time  i was excited to interview with amazon  a great company. the first round phone interview went very smoothly. the interviewer was very friendly. the question fair to easy for a first round. i guess i did well on the first round since i got to the second one. we set up a time for a second phone interview  however confirming receipt of the email slipped my mind  never let this kind of stuff happen . i only realized that an hour before the interview time. i quickly sent the interview coordinator an email. when she didn t reply within few minutes i gave her a call to try to save the situation. she said she will ping the interviewer and send me an email. after not receiving any sign for a while  i sent her a second email. very disappointingly  i didn t hear from her until six days later  very disrespectful   when i received an email saying that they have decided to proceed with other condidates. and apparently that decision was made based on the results of the first interview  a statement that contradicts the company s invitation for a second round interview. all this to say that i had a very bad experience overall  which seriously degraded the image i had of amazon. the actions of the interview coordinator unfortunately ruined an otherwise very enjoyable experience. i feel that my case was handled in a very unprofessional and disrespectful way.,question pretty basic and straightforward. java   difference between  steve    steve  and  steve .equals  steve   write code that finds common items in two unsorted lists. what s its complexity  how can you make it faster.   answer question

2012-11-23 12:09:11.813,a recruiter contacted me through linkedin and informed me about a recruiting event for amazon s ecommerce platforms division taking place in my area in a month. i was surprised that amazon would fly interviewing teams to different cities for recruitment  the usual process is for them to invite candidates to seatlle . i expressed interest and the recruiter asked me to go through a phone screen as early as possible because the interview slots were filling up. the interview team was going to be in my city only for two days. i setup the phone interview for the same day. the phone screen as quick and the interviewer asked me a somewhat difficult question that i did not expect interviewers to ask during a phone interview. he indicated that i need not code and that he wanted to just hear how i would solve the problem. fortunately for me  the insight on how to solve came pretty quickly and the interviewer seemed happy. after three days  i contacted the interviewer about my phone interview and he gave the good news that i had cleared it and that i would take part in the recruiting event in my city. he said he would contact me about exact date and time in the next few days which he did. the interview took place in a building in a famous area that amazon must have leased for the event. my interview loop consisted of a 15 minute intro by the recruiter  different from the one who contacted me through linkedin  followed by three 45 minute technical interview and one 45 minute hiring manager interview. i thought i screwed up the first one and did well on the other two technical interviews. the last one was not a technical  the questions were more about how i would handle stress  what to expect at amazon etc.  the recruiter said that amazon typically moves very quickly if they like a candidate and asked me to expect an email the same day  friday  or by sunday latest. the email finally arrived on sunday with good news after an agonizing wait.,i am not going to reveal the questions here. i had heard about the question that the first interviewer asked. it is an open ended question. the interviewer qucikly became frustrated with the direction i was going and had to rein me in a little bit. i was frustrated about why then he asked such an open ended question. anyway  his intentions were clear when he asked the follow up which i found to be an interesting one. but unfortunately time was running out at that point and i quickly suggested some ways i would solve the problem. in hindsight  i realized this was an important question because amazon had designed a product around it and uses it very heavily internally. the second interview was about the application of efficient data structures to solve a problem. i quickly arrived at the solution and coded it. there was more time left in the interview and we talked about problems arising in a distributed architecture setup. the third interviewer was nice and asked if i needed a restroom break. i gladly took his offer. this interview was also about the application of an efficient data structure. i initially proposed a multi threaded solution to his problem. he asked a few follow ups which i was able to answer. but he eventually asked me to give a single threaded solution which required the realization of a need for an efficient data structure. i quickly realized that i needed a data structure to solve a problem  but he had to give me some hints to arrive at the right one which ironically was what i had proposed for the question asked by the second interviewer. the last interview was not very technical. the interviewer asked about what i did my current role  how i would handle stress  what to expect at amazon etc.  after the interview was over  he walked me out of the building and wished me good luck.   answer question
