I gave my resume at my college career fair and scheduled for an on campus interview there. The interviewer asked for a pen, as he did not bring one. The interview was more behavioral, as I discussed my (minimal) experience. Then he had me write a simple nested for loop.

My interview was conducted over the phone and consisted of purely technical questions. The interviewer spoke softly and had a rather thick accent, which I don't hold against him but ultimately made every one of his utterances extremely difficult to understand. After this interview I was explicitly told that I'd be contacted with my results within 3 weeks, but Visa neglected to ever contact me. On top of this, Visa seems to have no consistency in how they conduct their interviews. I say this because I personally know people that had Visa phone interviews around the same time that I did, but their experiences were drastically easier and favored behavioral questions over technical.

Asked me about my resume & projects I had worked on. The originally scheduled 45 minute interview along with the interviewer were changed at the last minute. The replacement interviewer/Visa employee had a callous, condescending attitude and was not at all interested in interviewing him. He showed the least interest when I was talking about my projects. He asked if I could code in map-reduce but never gave me a coding question. 30 minute interview without coding.

Contacted by recruiter to arrange a 30-minute phone interview with an engineer, then invited to complete an online coding exercise. Invited onsite within a few days of the coding exercise for interviews, three 45-minute rounds of technical interviews with engineering staff. Interviewers seemed generally unhappy, and they asked vague questions and didn't provide much clarification when I asked for it. One interviewer was playing with their phone while I was telling him about myself. They took really long to get back to me.

Visa was at a career fair I attended, and they had a signup sheet for an on-campus interview the next day. I signed up, showed up to the interview, and talked to the engineer. The interview was a mix of very basic technical questions, very stereotypical behavioral questions, and a software design question. I didn't hear back from them after the interview.

Incredible interview process. It tested your ability to cope with long delays while your potential colleagues performed simple tasks, such as responding to your emails asking about your application status. Visa wants to measure how much patience you have, so they push you to the absolute edge to get an accurate estimate. My first interview was in October of 2014. (Note that I had to include the year.) After waiting weeks for a response, I was invited to an onsite. Weeks later, I received an online coding challenge. Months after that and after many emails from me encouraging the recruiting team to do their job (thereby testing my ability to communicate and work on a team), I finally received a response in April of 2015. Not many companies have the resources for an interview process that is this long. I guess they just want the best.

I gave them my resume at a seminar hosted by them. They called me back about 2 weeks later to schedule a phone interview. It's a very technical phone interview that you really must prepare for, or at least with the engineer I was set up with.

The phone interview contained a lot of questions about the mobile device I coded a lot of my side projects on, a lot of them would be difficult questions for an inexperienced mobile developer, so you must really know the architecture of that if that's where you interview revolves around.   Answer Question

The interview was held on-campus by an alumna, so it was not that stressful. I was caught off-guard since I didn't expect them to call me the day after the fair for the interview, especially since my hands were already full with a senior design project. The interview was not hard, but the two questions that I received were very specific and I didn't prepare for it (see the "Interview Questions" section). As to be expected, I did not get an offer.

In First Round he just asked tell me about yourself & software skills. Within 5 minutes interview is over & not selected. Interviewer is not that much good. There are totally 5 rounds. If you crack all these you will get offer. One of my friend selected. It was not that much tough. Mostly the panel matters where you have been interviewed. For us the interview was arranged by Infosys people.

For a fresher, Process starts with test(ofcourse intial PPT will be there). Test consists of five sectons. All are multiple choice type except programming round. programming round comprises of two programs. You have choice of any language C,C++,Java or PHP etc. An integrated IDE will be provided for the programming round. Programming round is very crucial, on executing two programs chances of shortlisting are more. 1) Programming 2) OS and dbms 3) Hadoop and Machine learning 4) infrastructure 5) networking and application security

A multiple choice test comprising of topics across all the domains of Computer science like Networking,infrastructure,Machine learning/Hadoop(these were a tough ask),Operating system and application security. Also there were two programming questions which were easy enough. The questions were as follows: 1. Given a word find the value of it according to a certain rule (The alphabets were given a value in a Fibonacci sequence) 2. Given resources and their worth and total time find the maximum value you can obtain from them.(Was a simple DP implementation) First Interview: The Interview started with basic "Tell me about yourself". Then the interviewer asked me a few questions on OOP's namely on Data encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism. Then he asked me one question on a binary tree. I didn't get through to the next round. There were 3 rounds of interview in total.

First round was a Telephonic round (Basic java ,Threads). Followed by 2 technical rounds(Topics covered are Data Structures,Threads,Design Patterns, S/w Dev Life cycle) and one coding round. For coding round they will give you a laptop and an editor (Eclipse) Basically in coding round they will give 3 questions 1.Basic logic's like fibonacci series 2.Algorithms (Searching , Sorting etc) 3.Threads ( producer consumer Problem ,Dinning etc) Followed by two HR rounds. TO DO's : 1)Get well versed with Threads.(they concentrate more on this) 2)In coding round if you don't know logic to any of the question don't give a blank paper. (try to solve it ,write more comments ) 3)Have a good understanding of DS(linked list ,hash map etc) and their time complexities. 4)HR rounds are treated more important than technical rounds.Make sure you are well prepared with below questions why are you leaving your current company? (This is a killer question ,even if you have strong technical skills you may simply lose offer because of this questions.The best and safe answer would be to say 'Looking for new Challenges' but be ready for subsequent question followed by that question. ) 5) DONT TRY TO IMPRESS manager or delivery manager with larger than life answers :) Make sure your answers cross the bar rather than looking for 99 marks out of 100.   Answer Question

I was hired as part of on campus recruitments at one of the IITs. VISA was a Day-0 company but their questions were way too simple compared to the rest of the companies in that slot. They have weird hiring policies. Postgraduates with 0 industry experience are directly hired to Senior SW Engg posts. Huge difference in salaries for the same profile based on the candidate's college. Interview questions were simple. There were some puzzles and some knowledge based questions. The coding questions were too simple and cliche like - reverse a linked list, merge sort, quick sort etc. I don't know how they can identify a candidate's coding skills based on such questions.
