First round was a Telephonic round (Basic java ,Threads). Followed by 2 technical rounds(Topics covered are Data Structures,Threads,Design Patterns, S/w Dev Life cycle) and one coding round. For coding round they will give you a laptop and an editor (Eclipse) Basically in coding round they will give 3 questions 1.Basic logic's like fibonacci series 2.Algorithms (Searching , Sorting etc) 3.Threads ( producer consumer Problem ,Dinning etc) Followed by two HR rounds. TO DO's : 1)Get well versed with Threads.(they concentrate more on this) 2)In coding round if you don't know logic to any of the question don't give a blank paper. (try to solve it ,write more comments ) 3)Have a good understanding of DS(linked list ,hash map etc) and their time complexities. 4)HR rounds are treated more important than technical rounds.Make sure you are well prepared with below questions why are you leaving your current company? (This is a killer question ,even if you have strong technical skills you may simply lose offer because of this questions.The best and safe answer would be to say 'Looking for new Challenges' but be ready for subsequent question followed by that question. ) 5) DONT TRY TO IMPRESS manager or delivery manager with larger than life answers :) Make sure your answers cross the bar rather than looking for 99 marks out of 100.   Answer Question
