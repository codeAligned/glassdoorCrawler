2015-10-16 08:44:59.873,i was referred by a current employee and was able to bypass the phone screen. they were very flexible with scheduling and i wanted to study a bit so i scheduled an onsite  the first of two  about a month out. i received an offer for another software engineering job and upon notifying my recruiter we were able to combine the 2 hour and 3 hour interviews into a single day 5 hour interview. at the onsite there were 4 interviews total. the first was a design question. it was intentionally severely underspecified. i had to design object oriented data structures and an algorithm to solve the problem. once i solved it the interviewer upped the difficulty by changing the problem parameters a but  what if the entire input won t fit into memory on a single machine . this pattern was typical throughout the day. two of the remaining interviews were typical algorithms questions such as those seen in cracking the coding interview. the last was a distributed systems design problem with no programming. i had to design a system from scratch  focusing on scalability  reliability  and performance. once the interview was over i had to wait about a week for the hiring committee to meet. i m not sure how much this was sped up by already having an offer. they met and gave the thumbs up. this wasn t an offer  but according to the recruiter was almost as good as one. i then met with the managers for three teams that were potential starting teams. these meetings were only 30 minutes so it was tough to decide. i then ranked the teams in order of my preference and sent that to the recruiter. i had to wait for the compensation committee  which was about another week later  6 days i think . i then got the official offer and start project over the phone from my recruiter and via e mail. they gave me 5 days to respond  although i m guessing this would have been flexible. i accepted the offer after picking a start date.,3 sum problem that can be found on leetcode.   answer question

2015-09-30 16:53:15.097,contacted by a recruiter who saw my linkedin profile. very brief phone screen with an hr representative  followed about a week later by a technical phone interview with a google engineer. he called about 7 minutes late  had a very strong accent  was using a phone with a poor connection  and did not seem to be focused on the interview  i could hear him getting facebook messages in the background . he also presented several things incorrectly  such as initially calling a list of numbers a set  which implies no repetitions  but later changing his mind to just a list. i eventually got the question right  but it took the entire length of the phone call and i believe there was another question that he wanted to ask. he also did not give me the 7 extra minutes at the end and kept reminding me that we were almost out of time. a few days later i got a call from my recruiter telling me they decided not to move on with the process. she gave no useful feedback and did not ask for nor seem to care about my feedback. all in all  i thought it was a fairly unprofessional experience and will probably never interview with google again.,find the difference between two unsorted sets  lists . interviewer eventually revealed that he wanted a solution in o n  time.   1 answer

2015-09-11 15:16:47.993,first off i ll say that there was a huge language barrier between my interviewer and i. he did not speak fluent english by a long shot. the choppy google voice connection mixed with him being fairly quiet didnt help either. he asked me questions like  what does it mean  when pointing to pieces of code  which i answered by explaining what that line did  which was not what he was looking for. in the beginning he also said to ask him any clarifying questions along the way  which i did. i had to repeat myself multiple times and he had trouble answering them in a way that made much sense to me. they are definitely looking for cs fundamentals. algorythms  data structures  runtimes  etc. you code in a google doc and they dont allow you to run or test your code  so you have to be pretty confident about writing the problem out correctly top to bottom. they didn t care at all about my practical  real world  software development experience  and instead only focused on academic cs fundamentals  as listed above. i even specifically asked if my industry experience was relevant  and they said no. so  in a way  i dont think it would have been a good fit for me anyways.,what is the runtime of  popular search algorythm   explain why.   answer question

2015-06-17 05:32:58.447,applied online and got back from a recruiter within an hour. had a conversation with the recruiter a week after and he said i can go straight to the onsite for interviews. i was interviewing many other places parallel so i scheduled the onsite two weeks after the day i spoke with the recruiter but they don t seem to care how quickly you take the onsite so choose time to give yourself enough time to prepare. there were five onsite interviews with one lunch with a developer  i heard that the lunch is not an interview . i had to write solutions on whiteboard for all of questions so be prepared. i never heard of any of questions they asked but studying leetcode and interview books helped me figure out ways to solve algorithm questions. all of the interviewers were nice and the interview felt like i m solving a real work problem with a coworker. think about time complexity and efficiency at all time when you come up with a solution. it took less than 2 weeks to get an offer. think this can be different for different people.,algorithm questions   answer question

2015-09-25 12:11:48.433,i was contacted by a recruiter in may for full time opportunities. i had interviewed before for an internship and january but i did not get an offer. the recruiter told me that she found my resume in their database. since i wasn t prepared to interview at that time  i asked my recruiter if i can give my phone interview in july. the recruiter agreed and asked me to remind her in june. i reminded the recruiter in june and i was scheduled for a phone interview in july. the recruiter gave me lots of topics to prepare. they mostly covered all the basics of computer science i studied in my undergraduate and graduate school. the phone interview took place using a shared google doc. i was asked 2 pretty simple questions which i coded and tested within 30 mins. however  there was a huge communication gap between me and my interviewer. the interviewer was not a native english speaker and was not able to understand my explanations. i was pretty disappointed as i thought that i messed it up even though it was no fault of mine.  note  this was the only negative experience throughout my process and it was completely overshadowed by the positive experiences later . the recruiter called me the following day and told that they wanted me to have a second phone interview as the first interview was inconclusive. i scheduled the second interview a week after. this interview was also on a shared google doc and my interviewer told me that the interview will be in two parts  one about cs fundamentals and the second would be some coding. for the first part we did not use the google doc and i was asked many questions about data structures  algorithms and complexity analysis. the questions will seem very easy if you are well prepared. the coding question was also pretty simple. two days later i was told that i have cleared the round and they want to schedule my on site interview at mountain view. i scheduled my interview a month later and the recruiter gave me a lot of material and links to refer for my preparation. the recruiter was extremely helpful and she even wished me luck a day before my onsite. the onsite consisted of 4 technical interviews and a lunch with an engineer. the lunch was not evaluative. all the 4 interviews were white board coding and they tested my coding  algorithm and basic computer science skills. the interviewers were extremely nice. at the end of the day  i was feeling very happy with the level of discussions i was able to have with the interviewers. my recruiter called me about an hour after my last interview to inform that she had already received a couple of interview reviews and they look pretty positive. 3 days later  my recruiter told me that she received all the interview reviews and the comments were very positive and that she would be sending my package to the hiring committee. i heard back from my recruiter about a week later that the hiring committee has approved my application and it will now go for compensation and executive review. a week from there  my recruiter scheduled a hangout call with me where she explained my offer.    even though the entire process was spread over months  it was a really pleasant experience. my recruiter was exceptional and she replied very promptly to all my emails and kept updating me regularly at every step of the process. now i am looking forward to join google the coming year once i graduate.,given a list of int  039 s where each number exists twice  except one  find missing duplicate in the fastest possible time.   2 answers

2015-09-09 18:13:16.013,prior to this round of interviews  i had 3 technical phone interviews back in january that allowed me to proceed directly to onsite this time. on site i had 4 technical interviews where i wrote code on a whiteboard  1 interview discussing my phd research and how i could apply it and my skills to google  and i went out to lunch with another employee so i had the opportunity to ask questions about the culture  projects  environment at google. overall experience was good. all interviewers were very nice and if i was stuck  most knew how to give a hint by asking a question or providing an example that my solution may or may not handle. recommendations  of course  brush up on all your coding and algorithms  and practice writing on a whiteboard if you can. also  be sure to optimize your whiteboard space as you write  make sure you go in there knowing how the work and experience you have done could apply to google. for me  my interviewer and i never seemed like we were on the same page so this could have been hurtful to me. downside  i asked my recruiter for any kind of feedback as to why i wasn t made an offer and so that i could improve my skills  but she did not give me anything.,nda  but typical linked list  array  and string manipulations involving sorting and searching  and one question focusing on computer architecture. asked to optimize for time and or storage and to discuss the trade offs.   answer question

2015-07-22 12:01:25.833,i interviewed with the google la office in venice. process was fairly quick. recruiter contacted me by email and set up a technical phone interview. phone interview was with a software engineer and it was a data structure algorithm question  basic question was to remove duplicates from a list of strings . it was about 45 minutes. engineer sounded friendly and asked me to optimize the solution. i thought it went well. after a couple of days  recruiter called me to setup an onsite interview. you know the drill. google onsite consists of 5 interviews   4 coding interviews and 1 design interview and a lunch session  you will need it to recharge between coding sessions . the onsite interviews were more difficult than the phone interview. my only tip if you really want a job at google will be to practice data structure and algorithm questions... especially tress and graphs. 3 of my coding interviews were trees and graphs questions. the  programming interviews  book is pretty useful to brush up on these concepts and similar questions. i thought 3 of my interviews went well  the other two not so good. it all depends who you get to interview with also. one interviewer constantly interrupted me as i was writing code on the board  and repeatedly asking me to keep revising my solution. i ended up not having enough time to complete it.,you are given a set of unsorted strings to work with. construct a program that will suggest autocorrect words as they are typed.  the unsorted strings are the valid words .   2 answers
2015-09-02 10:26:09.26,purely algorithmic. 5 interviews  45 minutes each and a lunch interview. the first problem was a graph search problem solvable using dfs and knowing about disjoint sets. second problem was a linked list problem. third problem was a data structure problem. fourth problem was a views  45 minutes each  on site  divided as follows  3 on coding and algorithms  1 on object oriented design  and 1 on high level system design. i also had lunch  1 hour  with an engineer  where i got to sample their famous free food and talk informally about life at google. like many other folks  i came in expecting very difficult and brain warping questions. but to my pleasant surprise  none of the questions were particularly hard at all. the whiteboard coding and object oriented design problems were really straightforward  very similar to the types of questions you ll get asked at most other major silicon valley tech firms. the system design question was a bit trickier  but it was ultimately just an open ended discussion which felt pretty similar to real life engineering design discussions that i do frequently at work. i definitely got the feeling that they don t care so much whether you  solve  the problem per se  but rather they focus more about how you analyze and approach the problem and how effectively you engage the interviewer in communicating your ideas. personally  i really enjoyed all my interactions  and felt very engaged and energetic throughout the entire on site interview day. after the on site interviews  i received a call the next day from my recruiter  who told me that the feedback looked good and that i would be moved to the hiring committee stage. within another three days  i was told the good news that i d cleared the hiring committee  supposedly with flying colors  although perhaps the recruiter was just trying to flatter me  . they then checked my references and asked for details about my current compensation and competing offers. finally  it took another week after that to do the team matching and receive the formal offer.,can  039 t disclose due to nda. but as mentioned above  i did 3 coding interviews  1 object oriented design interview  and 1 high level system design interview. the coding questions were of just average difficulty  i would say they are no harder than the types of questions asked at most other major silicon valley tech firms. also  one of the coding interviews involved a few knowledge based questions on java  which i d told my recruiter was my most familiar programming language  so they do seem to do some verification of your claimed expertise .   answer question

2015-08-06 16:43:39.51,i received a phone call from a recruiter. we talked for roughly 45 minutes about my technical background and experiences  as well as the sorts of positions that are available currently in software engineering at google. this was followed up one week later by a technical interview that consisted of two programming questions and almost no other discussion. i received my negative response from them a few hours later. i completed both questions with a little time to spare and without receiving help from the interviewer. the two shortcomings i saw in the interview that could have led to their decision not to move forwards were  1. i briefly forgot the syntax for array declaration as it is not something i commonly use. 2. i decided to use a brute force iterative implementation rather than the more complex recursive solution to the problems. my advice to others would be to make sure you re 100  refreshed on the syntax of the language you will be interviewing in  and it may be worthwhile to attempt the riskier  flashy answer rather than the more basic solution.,without going into specifics  for the technical interview  i was asked questions about manipulating arrays.   answer question

2015-01-23 17:17:22.24,i got contacted by a recruiter through linked in. after a behavioral interview and a phone screen  topic  input sorting   see the interview question below  i was flown out to kirkland to interview in person. the interview process there was pretty typical compared to what you see here   several interviews over the course of a day  each about an hour long along with an hour for lunch  and each covering one or two questions. the people were all pretty nice   i enjoyed talking with both my recruiters  the first recruiter  who did recruiting for multiple offices  and the second recruiter  who dealt only with the washington area  although the salary negotiations were pretty annoying   be prepared to deal with tactics meant to push your salary lower than you would want otherwise  although the offer was pretty damn reasonable to begin with  so i can t complain . i m not sharing any questions from the interview process here  as per the frequently mentioned nda  suffice to say that you will receive ample information on what you need to prepare ahead of time. see other reviews for what your interview will look like   they re all pretty much on the ball. after the interview  you re run past a hiring committee  then submitted to vps for approval  then salary negotiations  followed by the final offer., from the phone screen  given a set of inputs  sort them such that the proceeding digit alternates higher  then lower than the preceding digit  i.e. 1  5  2  8  5  10  1  6  2  3  1  3  2  10    answer question

2014-12-29 12:48:10.307,there were a series of emails exchanged and i was passed through three different recruiters. i proceeded to an initial phone interview to discuss skills  background  and next steps. the recruiter i spoke with on the phone was curt. she asked a few broad questions  including why i would want to work at google. i replied that i enjoy fast development with a small  agile team. she misunderstood me and suggested that i should apply to facebook instead because they have a more constant release cycle. this question and her generally haughty tone left me feeling pretty defensive and not trilled about continuing. nevertheless  i was given a technical phone interview a week and a half later. i did not know what to expect from the technical phone interview. i was sent an email detailing a long list of potential subjects  which i studied broadly. instead  i should have been practicing coding problems. the technical interview consisted entirely of two programming questions. i coded on a google document along with the interviewer. i could only partially complete both questions. the first question was   given a binary search tree populated with numbers  find the closest match to an incoming number.  the other question was   given an array of strings  find the common prefix.  i left the interview knowing i had very little chance of continuing. despite this  the recruiter called about a week and a half later to decline  but invited me to try again in  12 15 months . the call left a sour taste in my mouth as i again experienced a condescending attitude in a scripted call  especially when a simple email would have sufficed.,how would you detect whether a string is an anagram of a palindrome    1 answer

2014-12-03 21:04:44.413,i got contacted by a google recruiter sometime in september about a new grad software engineering position in mountain view. following an initial phone call briefly going over my resume and talking about my interest in google  the recruiter set up a 45 minute phone coding interview. unfortunately  no one actually called me as scheduled for my interview  so i contacted my recruiter and she rescheduled. after this interview took place  i was contacted about a week later saying that they wanted to do a second phone interview before deciding whether or not to bring me onsite for final rounds. i had that set up a couple of weeks later and then heard back again within a week that they wanted to fly me out for onsite interviews. at this point i was also transferred to another recruiter who dealt with onsite interviews and the rest of the recruiting process. i was flown out in early november for a day of four 45 minute whiteboard coding interviews with a lunch break in between the first two and the last two. overall  it was one of my better onsite interview experiences and the interviewers were receptive to actively participating in the process  not just telling you the problem and then sitting there in silence . i even had one interviewer who took extra time after the interview to go into more detail explaining another way that i could have solved the problem. the engineer i had lunch with was also very nice and helped to paint a good picture of what working at google would be like. following this  my recruiter made sure to keep me updated as to how things were going in the review process. i heard back in about a week that my feedback from the interviews would be going through the hiring committee. then  a few days after that i heard back that i passed the hiring committee and needed to have my package submitted for executive review. about a week after this i got an email from my recruiter saying i had the offer  we discussed the details over the phone and i accepted the offer the following week. all in all  from onsite to getting the offer was a little over 2 weeks. while it was certainly a lengthy process  september   end of november  this wasn t all google s fault and i appreciated the recruiters keeping me up to date every step of the way.,signed nda  can t reveal my questions. study data structures  study text parsing  text searching  pretty much anything text related. it might seem like an overload on one topic  but remember...they are a search company at heart.   answer question

2015-04-08 15:34:07.437,the process was very long and stressful. this was my second time interviewing at google. after an phone screening  i was invited to the office for an onsite interview. my interviews happened to be split up between two visits. i had three interview on my first visit and three more on my second. the interviews were fairly relaxed and i managed to find solutions to each interview question  but was still denied an offer. given my performance during the interviews  the recruiter was willing to work with me on finding a team at google that might be a good fit for me  and then try to appeal to the hiring committee once more. speaking with teams combined with long wait times for feedback resulted in a 4 and half month long interviewing process. in the end  i wasn t given an offer. appreciate google effort in trying to find a place for me  but the process was draining and raised my hopes several times only for me to leave with nothing in the end. i don t see myself interviewing for google again  unless i had better assurance for faster feedback.,No Question

2015-01-07 11:59:33.717,context  i had been contacted by different google recruiters over the past few years  and had been referred internally but i didnt know about that  and i had kept asking them to contact me later. first contact  i was then again contacted first for an s.r.e position. the recruiter took a mini 5 10 interview about time complexities and some linux systems questions which they expected people to be well versed in. the recruiter was a little misleading about what the position was about and made it sound alot closer to s.w.e than it actually is. i did my research spoke with people who interviewed for sre. i then insisted that i wanted to interview for swe. the recruiter tried hard to convince me to apply for sre but my heart was not in it. eventual contact  after 1 2 conversations with the recruiter  i was then handed over to another recruiter for swe. i had multiple conversations so that they can ascertain which team should interview me and what should be a good fit. they really do try to set you up for success  i can assure you that much. they were unable to initially be precise about which team i would be a fit for. so they suggested that i atleast do the phone interview  which would be reaosonably generic  and then that would give them some clues. phone interview stage  i gave the phone interview and next day got an email that they want to move forward. i then spoke with a different recruiter who was supposed to handle my case. i again had some clarifying conversations with her about my strengths and interests and made sure that my onsite interview would be something that i expected it to be. this recruiter was fantastic and very detail oriented. i had limited time because i had 2 existing offers whose deadlines were approaching. they scheduled my interview on a day of my choosing. onsite interview stage  the onsite interview went well. the interviewers were friendly and polite. some young  some slightly older. they were excited to be a part of google. i had a great time talking and solving questions. the interview questions were not very difficult. i concentrated alot on code organization  cleanliness and correctness. debugging my code in the interviews and convincing myself and the interviewer of the absolute correctness was very important. if you are comfortable with recursion  dynamic programming  arrays  trees etc that should be fine. i dont think they really wanted to test knowledge of advanced concepts. they concentrated more on basic fundamentals  good solutions  clean   correct code. there were 5 technical interviews and 1 lunch interview. the lunch interview was not technical. it was me who was asking the constant questions in that time. post interview stage  since i was on a tight timeline  things moved at lightning speed. i couldnt imagine that it was possible for this to be done so soon. on the same day of my interview  i got a positive response and my packet for the hiring committee was being prepared. they checked out my references the next day and by nightfall the next day  i knew i was approved by the hiring commitee. offer phase  the verbal offer was given 2 days later. 2 days of negotiation. i was given the final written letter basically within a week of my interview which i signed. over all  the recruiter was diligent and fast. i couldnt keep up  it was that quick. i was very lucky i would say to work with the right people. i made sure i myself was prompt at every stage.,i cannot disclose the questions. some system programming  fact based questions were unexpected.   answer question

2014-10-09 11:20:53.353,get email from recruiter stating that they wish to contact me because i dropped my resume last year  and see if i am still interested to this position. after that i had an interview with one of the engineers. interview was fair  including some behavior questions and one technical question. i was asked to talk about the algorithm to the problem  its complexity before writing it down on google doc. after i finished i was also asked to state any potential problems. after 2 days i got a call from recruiter and said i need to have a secondn interviewer asked three coding questions  but the first was just a warm up.  on two interviews i answered all questions before time ran out. on one interview  the interviewer made me realize the function i had just coded up wouldn t solve the problem  right as time ran out. i held him back for a few seconds as i drew out the correct solution on the board for him. on the last interview  the time ran out before i could code up the answer to the problem. it was all data structures and algorithms with no architecture questions  but that s probably because i was a new grad. one interviewer was friendly and enthusiastic. two of them were pretty withdrawn  so i had no idea whether they liked what i was doing or not. the last one was blunt and quick to tell me when i was doing something wrong  but he also never brushed off my questions or weird algorithm ideas. two weeks after the onsite interview  i got an offer for after graduation. i feel like coding interviews are just as much psychological as they are technical. you have to keep a cool head during a stressful situation and accept criticism with good grace. you also have to be able to communicate your ideas really quickly and effectively. i drew out diagrams on the whiteboard as i was brainstorming  having visual aids really helps.,i was surprised when the first thing they asked about was the prior experience on my resume. i was expecting only technical questions and hadn t brushed up on my past projects.   answer question

2014-11-07 19:43:00.857,about three weeks after submitting my application online  i was contacted to schedule two 45 min technical phone interviews with engineers. we worked over a google doc  and i was asked several technical questions and asked to write small snippets of code. i thought the questions were very fair  if not a bit too easy. the first phone interview was pretty much 100  problem based  with five minutes at the end for questions of my own. the second phone interview was less problem oriented and more concept oriented. they asked about my projects and interests  and also asked questions that required some critical thinking. i thought the first interview went okay  but not great. the second one  however  seemed to go flawlessly. a little over a week after my interviews  i received a call with an offer.,randomize an array  ensuring no items are in the same position they were in originally.   answer question
2014-10-28 14:04:58.153,recruiter contacted me on my old school email  said he had me resume on file from when i interviewed a couple of years ago. i talked with the recruiter very briefly over the phone. he described the role and asked me if it was something i would be interested in  seemed like a very heavy software coding role. i said it was  and then he asked for me to send an updated resume and he would setup the phone interview. phone interview was setup for a week away. interviewer called on a very poor phone line  and was probably on speaker phone. luckily we moved to the google doc that was setup for the interview and when i could not understand the interviewer he would type the info on the doc. the interview was pretty straight forward.the interviewer asked three questions  two dealing with arrays  and one dealing with a linked list. i struggled a bit through the first question. i worked through it  and the recruiter asked the typical solution time complexity questions  and how can you make it faster  etc. question 2 i struggled for about 5 minutes to come up with a solution. i was explaining to the interviewer my thought process as i was trying to come up with a way to solve the problem  but that just confused him and he asked if i would just code it  but i wasn t coding it because i had no ideas yet on how to solve the problem.    after about another minute i came up with a solution. i started coding it and once the interviewer saw that once i had come up with a solution and was able to code it without a hitch he asked me to move onto another question. this was the linked list question  and i knew a solution right away and coded it without any issues. somewhere in there he asked me  do you have experience designing backend databases   this is more of a question i would expect for a dba role  not a typical software engineer interview question. anyway i answered him  and that was pretty much the end of the interview. he asked me if i had any questions and i did  and he gave a good answer back... this was my second interview with google. the first one was a disaster  so i was pretty pleased with the outcome of this interview. i struggled a bit  but was able to answer the questions. two weeks later i emailed the recruiter and asked if he had heard any results from the interview. he set up a time to talk and when he called he told me that i had done well in the interview but that they found another candidate better suited for the position. overall a pretty good experience.,find the deepest node of a binary tree. if multiple nodes are at the deepest level  then return the rightmost node.   1 answer

2014-08-15 19:19:19.227,first step was to submit an application through google s online system  which included a resume and  optional  cover letter. i was contacted by a recruiter within 3 days  including the weekend  and set up an interview for 2 weeks from that date. it was two back to back technical phone interviews. the interviewers let you choose what language you wish to demonstrate your knowledge in. i chose java for both. my first interviewer was great. he introduced himself and throughout the interview  was very proactive on trying to guide me through a difficult part of the problem or hinted if he wanted more to the solution. i had to constantly verbalize my thought process  as it was a phone interview  so he mainly responded to that. my second interviewer was not so great. he was 10 minutes late and seemed like he didn t want to help at all. even after his  explanation  of the problem  including a confusion inducing analogy  i was still a bit uncertain about the problem  so i just went with what i thought was right. it ended up being mostly correct until he literally started to yell at me over the phone for the last line  which was parsing an object to an int  then back to an object when there was another method that did what i was trying to do already  which he didn t explain  so i didn t know what it was  go figure . he seemed to not be paying attention at all  as there were multiple times where i asked a question  only to be answered with silence. after that  i received a follow up email from the recruiter  stating i would know the results in a week or so. i ended up not getting the position  most likely due to that second interviewer   but am not deterred from applying again. i will admit my java was definitely not up to par  considering that wasn t the dominant language i programmed in for the past half year and only really  studied  for two weeks before the interview.,prove p   np   1 answer

2015-04-15 07:29:18.367,the process began with a recruiter on linkedin contacting me after viewing my profile. the first phone screen was with the recruiter and seemed to be directed towards  placement  in the company. questions involved things like  do you like front end or back end coding more     what is the time complexity of quicksort     how would you estimate some large exponential function  . there were 0 questions regarding experience or resume information. the second phone screen was with a technical interviewer within the company. the phone connection was awful  the speakerphone on google s end increased the awfulness  the poor english of the interviewer increased the awfulness even more  and the lack of respect and attentiveness of the interviewer was the icing on the awful cake. the interviewer was not interested in any discussion of my experience or resume at all. he began by asking an esoteric math related programming problem. i frequently asked questions of the interviewer and was met with no response. at some point  i thought the phone dropped out because of 2 minutes of silence even after i asked multiple times if the interviewer was still there. eventually  the interviewer said he had to leave to use the bathroom while i was struggling and asking questions. he didn t return for 15 minutes. after my time was up  the interviewer said  ok  time is up  good bye  and hung up on me. this isn t how a company as large as google should be conducting interviews. after notifying the recruiter of the poor interview  she set me up with a third phone screen. the third phone screen had a much more attentive and polite interviewer. again  no questions regarding experience or resume information were asked. we began immediately by working in a google docs window about solving a path finding problem. google docs is really bad with code formatting and syntax highlighting  so it was a bit of a nightmare to type out a solution. i left this interview feeling a little better. the final part of the process was to schedule onsite interviews in mountain view  ca. i was bounced between 2 3 different recruiters and a third party travel agency  so coordinating the travel was frustrating. i m surprised my application wasn t lost during all the transfers. the onsite process was similar to other tech companies in the sense that there was a long  full day of interviews. in total  there were 6 interviews across a 7 hour period with a lunch interview shoved in there somewhere. many of the interviewers seemed to be bored or not interested in conducting interviews  so it was a similar experience as my second phone screen. i get the feeling that google forces their engineers to perform interviews but doesn t hold them accountable to the quality of their interview process. in addition  many interviewers spoke poor english and couldn t successfully communicate the problem that i was required to solve. and finally  i was never asked experience or resume related questions. google simply doesn t seem to care about experience. in the end  i was contacted with the standard  we are not moving forward with your application  with no feedback that would allow me to improve.,writing a function that calculates points in a circle implementing some features of google docs   answer question

2014-07-15 17:05:52.82,contacted by the recruiter  interview was scheduled around 3 weeks later. i had 2 back to back interviews  each for  50 mins. i will not disclose the questions because i respect the nda  but generally the google interviewers like to start with a question and make it more and more difficult as the interview proceeds. the first interviewer was not as friendly. in fact he was a little intimidating. the question that he asked  i hadn t even heard of it despite the fact that i always over prepare  and in the first 2 mins i really thought i am gonna screw this up since i had no clue where to start from  but i anyways started and was surprised by my own performance. they are not looking for people who have crammed the code line by line and just write it perfectly. they are looking for people who can think and implement on the fly. the second interviewer was pretty cool and when he asked the question  it was a piece of cake  but i was amazed to see how difficult he made it as the interview proceeded. at a couple of points  he even told me that he just expected a verbal solution since there was not much time left to write the code  but i told him i will write the code instead  which i did. needless to say  he was very impressed by my enthusiasm all throughout the interview. i was contacted by the recruiter in less than 4 business days that i qualified for the 2nd round  and after 3 weeks i had a host matching interview with a team. i took the offer. the best tip i ever got   always review your code before you say  i am done . walk through code  see that you have covered all the edge cases and say you are done when you are done.,none were easy  but won t disclose any because of the nda.   answer question
2014-06-06 15:18:17.857,the first interview was a behavior interview. the recruiter asked some question about my resume  such as the projects i have participated in  and my previous work experience. since the position i apply was software engineer  so she also ask me about my professional skill like which programming language i am most familiar with. this behavior was easy  but unfortunately  there were still 6 months to graduate that time  the recruiter told me they can t wait that long.,why you quit last job.   answer question
2014-07-09 21:20:43.007,timeline    reached out to recruiter  day 0   call with recruiter  day 2   in person interview  day 15   calls with managers  days 28   32   three offer revisions  days 33   43 in person interview  a pretty standard affair with 5 45 minute inreviews and a lunch after the first 2. most of the people seemed genuinly interested in the interview  save 1 person who seemed annoyed at having to do such a menial task  and were a lot of fun to talk to. i can t go into too much detail on the questions themselves  covered by nda   but it s standard fare and if you know your stuff  you won t have any trouble. how to prepare  just brush up on your algorithm design  iterative recursive algs  big o  etc . it might be helpful to just read up on some really clever algorithms from your academic days since the thought processes for those can have a lot in common with algorithms you might be asked to design. culture  the people who interviewed me seemed intelligent and very happy to be working at google. one surprising factor for me was that every single person answered  what s you favorite part of working at google   the same way   the people .,follow up with this  someone modified your binary search code and the result is bad modified version may not be binary search any more . create a test case to find out whether the code is binary search without source code on hand.   answer question

2014-08-23 22:14:05.08,was approached by a recruiter  we had an initial phone screen. from there  i had a technical phone interview with a swe. the questions were pretty straight forward  nothing too difficult. after that  i had four on site interviews. two of them went very well  one went pretty well  and i did pretty poorly in the other. i signed an nda  so i can t go into details  but my suggestion to anyone would be to prepare as much as you can.,i signed an nda and cannot disclose questions. however in my case  there were no complicated questions. i could choose to code either on a chromebook or on the whiteboard.   answer question
2014-06-15 17:50:33.853,a recruiter contacted me  mentioning he is following up with past codejam participants. while i am not really intending to change jobs at this point  i decided to take an interview. i talked with him on the phone and he asked simple questions  e.g.  experience in developing mobile apps  intention to move to california  etc. . he introduced me another recruiter who is in seattle. i talked with her on the phone and she scheduled an onsite interview at the seattle office. i didn t have phone interviews  possibly because i have passed through ones in the past  rejected at onsite   or possibly because i m currently working in seattle and they don t need to reimburse for transportation and lodging. i had interviews with 5 engineers   1 engineer for lunch . questions were rather simple and with moderate difficulty. while i thought i did well on the questions  the recruiter called me a week after the interview and told me that the hiring committee decided not make an offer. as other people also say  they don t give me any feedback  but the recruiter mentioned it was  close   though i don t know if she actually had detailed information about my interview. what s frustrating and made me feel negative about the process is that they do not give me any feedback. i don t even know if it was because of my performance at the interview or because of my past experience  i m not a software engineer right now and coding is not my main job responsibility . i explicitly asked this point to the recruiter but she didn t clarify. i m suspecting it s the latter and if that s the case  this whole process was totally a waste of time  but i never know. another reason for my negative feeling is that the recruiter left a message on my home phone saying that she needs to follow up about the interview. the fact i was taking an interview was secret to my family and i ve repeatedly asked the recruiter not to call my home phone  but she didn t care about that. this has brought a situation in my family  even bigger than the fact that i was rejected. recruiters should be more careful about each candidate s privacy  though failed candidates may not be important to them.,how would i implement the autocomplete function on an iphone or google search    answer question

2014-07-23 18:48:50.64,recruiter contacted me via email or linkedin  can t remember exactly. asking if i would be interested in google. i have a long resume and somewhat specialized set of skills in embedded systems so i said ok i will give it a go  but that i am not quite sure how my skills would be useful at google. they waived the phone screen and moved me directly to an onsite interview. they send you a list of things to go over to prepare for the interview that looks like something out of college computer science course. i was really busy at my current job so i had little time to go over it  but it was fun revisiting the basic algorithms and data structures. onsite was 3x45 miutes 1on1 interviews  lunch and 2 more 45 mins sessions. all back to back  no breaks other than lunch. 1st session  interviewer introduced himself gave me time to introduce myself for the 1st 10 mins. then asked 2 questions. 1st was arrays didnt require to writ code  2nd was dynamic programming asked to wrote code. i did well on both so we had 10 more mins to spare where i asked him questions. 2nd session  introduction took a really long time  interviewer talked at great length about himself and his work. asked me if i am interviewing for real or just there to get some interview experience  because apparently thats what he did initially himself. when we got to the question there was only about 15 mins left. tree related question  that in my opinion wasn t really presented very well. code was required. i started solving it but he was basically walking me through every step. not sure if he just wanted to pass me or realized that he already spent too much time talking. got the correct solution  but i felt like i was being lead to it. 3rd session  embedded systems engineer  asked me a lot about my actual resume. in the end asked me a pretty basic question embedded system specific  asked to write code. was really easy for me  did really well. probably the most enjoyable session. lunch  the weirdest part of the day. interviewer only got notified the night before  didnt look like wanted to be there. didn t even know where the closest cafeteria was. ended up walking for about 15 mins around the campus. dropped the tray when getting food and spilled lunch over clothes  got really upset. then suggested we sit outside because its quieter there. but the day was hot and it was really uncomfortable  i was glad to get back inside. 4th session  usual introductions. general distributed systems question. went pretty well in my opinion  but then i am not a distributed systems specialist  so cant really judge. 5th session  the worst one ofthe day. usual introductions. 2 questions. 1st question supposed to be a warmup  really simple bit manipulation  but for some reason my brain just went into a feeze  not sure if it was the stress or the sun from the lunch. anyway i worked manually through some samples and did come up with an algorithm and a correct solution. in fact the interviewer corrected something in my solution  but when i started running it through a test case it turned out my initial code was in fact correct  so we reverted it. because 1st question took so much time  we only had about 10 mins for the 2nd one which was supposed to be the main question. so we didn t really finish it. recruiter called me a week later saying that they decided not to go forward with my candidacy at this time. i am not really too bothered since i am pretty happy at my current job and this was more of a learning experience  but i admit that if they did make me a good offer  i would ve seriously considered it. while driving home i did come up with a really good solution to that unfinished question from the 5th session. and then also found every single question that i got asked in my interview on programming websites. so looks like if i wasn t so busy and just spent more time preparing  the interview would ve gone much smoother. i thought just experience would be enough to pull me through. other than the lunch person and the 2nd session interviewer  everybody else was very pleasant and enjoyable to talk to.,all were unexpected. i didnt prepare for any  but was able to work through most of them. none really difficult under normal circumstances.   answer question
2014-05-17 06:34:59.94,i was not looking to switch jobs  but i was contacted out of the blue by a recruiter on linkedin. i was happy with my job that i held with the same company since college graduation  10 years . however  i decided to give google a shot. if anything it would probably teach me something about myself. the recruiter set up a phone interview for roughly 1 month later. i apparently did well as the recruiter contacted me about 2 hours after the interview to say i passed. i was forwarded off to a recruiter in mountain view that set up an on site interview for about 1.5 months later. i m sure the time frames here could have been quicker  but for each step i wanted time to study. during the on site interview  i met with 5 different engineers  4 where feedback was taken and 1 lunch interview . each interview lasted between 45 minutes and 1 hour. i interviewed with members from 2 specific teams  the potential ones i would be joining if offered a position. despite the fact the lunch interview was not supposed to count  i was told that the lunch interviewer was instrumental in getting me hired. it took quite a long time after the on site interview until i received an offer. it took 2 weeks to collect interview feedback and 1 week to get the go ahead to put me through the hiring committee. it took 2 weeks to go through the hiring committee and an additional week to go through the executive committee. at that point i had an offer  but it took another day or two to negotiate the details. i initially wanted to decline the offer since i was leery of moving my family  but the recruiter gave me the weekend to think about it. i verbally accepted after the weekend. it took another two days to choose a relocation package and 1 more day to receive a formal offer letter which i electronically signed. i hope i made the right choice  i am worried that i took a step or two down in responsibility  but the compensation was a little bit better than what i was making even cost of living adjusted. if anything i ll have an interesting experience to talk about and google on my resume.,however  i received 2 different dynamic programming problems which i didn t expect and i found to be quite difficult. 3 of the interviewers had me do whiteboard work but only 1 of them actually had me do any coding  which was a basic singly linked list type problem.   answer question

2014-10-13 09:48:20.74,i applied through google s online web form  and was very surprised to be contacted by a google recruiter a couple of weeks later    i had no contacts at the company  and applying via web forms usually doesn t work. after some short communications with the recruiter  i scheduled an on site interview in new york city. the best part of the google interview process is that they tell you exactly what to expect. the recruiter sent me a list of topics and suggested study materials  and the interviews didn t have any questions that weren t covered in that list of topics. i spent about three weeks studying for the interview  and didn t have any surprises when i finally got there. google is very good about arranging transportation for the interviews. they covered all costs for me to fly to nyc and spend one night before my interview. google paid for airfare and hotel directly  and reimbursement for meals and public transit was quick and easy. after the in person interviews  there were two stages of hiring committees.  i heard about this from my recruiter  but didn t have any contact with the committees beyond my on site interviews.  during this time  i had phone interviews with several team leaders  trying to figure out where i would best fit. part of this process was for the google managers to decide if they wanted me  but it was at least as much for my benefit    after several of these phone interviews  i picked the team which seemed to be the best fit for me. everyone was very friendly  and the entire interview process was smooth and enjoyable.,there were no difficult or unexpected questions.   answer question

2014-05-27 14:59:41.3,i applied and was contacted by a recruiter within 2 days. i was given a long checklist of things to review and told i would be given a phone interview in about 10 days. i prepared quite a bit  but there s only so much you can do. you have to be a little lucky with who you get and hope you both find the same topics important. that said  i ve been told the interview process at google is a bit silly and i have to agree. it did not feel very kind  at least. my interviewer started with  hi i m an engineer at google and you have an interview schedule for this time. is this still a good time  okay good. let s start with the following question   . very little small talk  straight into a coding question. okay  no prob. except i could hear him typing away on his keyboard the whole time. there was basically zero commentary while i was coding  and nothing to say about my  thinking out loud . i completed the question  perhaps it took a bit longer than it should have  but it s an interview....nerves are gonna play a part. anyway  i was definitely being scored on a timer. there is little doubt about that in my mind. if i wasn t given a timed score  then i lost points for there not being enough time to get around to other questions. he did go through it line by line  and i fixed all the little mistakes  which of course never would have happened in an ide  and wound up with some decent code. it wasn t the best thing in the world  but it was fast and it worked. after the weekend i was told they would be going with some more experienced candidates. so again  little doubt in my mind that my score was somehow lessened due to the amount of time i took on the problem. i didn t sit and do nothing  i just wrote out code  then replaced it with something cleaner or better. moved some sloppy stuff into a new function  etc.,google asks that we do not share their questions  so i won t share the entire thing. i will however say that it was a common question  think along the lines of reverse a string  calculate fib sequence  etc  with a little twist thrown in which should just cause you to hesitate and think a bit  even if you ve seen the core of this problem before. it was by all means a fair question.   answer question

2014-06-17 07:25:26.28,my resume was referred by a current employee. i got a call from a recruiter a couple weeks later and had a 10 minute conversation with her about the whole process  bit on my background  and what i m looking for. she sent me an email with all of the content that is considered fair game for an interview. i asked for a month to study before the phone interview. the phone interview was 45 minutes  with maybe 35 of it being technical questions and coding in a google doc. the recruiter called me later that day saying they wanted to bring me in for on site interviews. i asked for them to be scheduled as soon as possible  already been studying  didn t want to forget anything . the on site interviews were scheduled for almost 3 weeks later. my round of interviews on site wasn t as smooth as the recruiter claims they usually are. i was taken to a small conference that was to be my  home  for the day and the recruiter wrote the schedule of who and when on the white board. the first guy that showed up was not the one listed. second guy was 15 minutes late. last guy of the day turned out to be working at home and they had to substitute on the fly  15 minute delay again . not really a big deal  but i think worth noting. the interviews themselves were 45 minutes each  again about 35   40 minutes of which were technical questions and coding on the white board. all questions fell within the review content suggested by the email. one interview was more of a design approach interview and np complete did come up once. in general the questions were designed to be challenging  but solvable in the time frame. to study  i read wikipedia pages and took notes for the topics mentioned in the email. i used a couple other materials for design and integration patterns. this worked as sufficient review for me. my final comment is regarding how i think they determine level. i was out of undergrad for four years when i interviewed. my experience in the field is longer than that. the recruiter said for their purposes my level was  four years   which i think worked in my favor because they expected less.,the design approach interview was the hardest simply because it s far more open ended.   1 answer
2014-04-09 09:09:01.17,i submitted my cv online and and was contacted by a recruiter. after communicating with the recruiter a technical phone interview was scheduled with a coding session via a shared google doc. following the phone interview a follow second technical phone interview was scheduled. google decided not to proceed after the second interview.,the coding questions weren t particularly difficult  however they were very open ended. this means discussing your thoughts out loud as you progress through the question is the most important factor.   answer question
2014-05-20 08:31:56.55,one in person interviewer openly told me that he hates his job and that he would not recommend anyone work at google...when he first walked into the room  he didn t even say hello  it was just the first thing he said  overall after speaking with 6  people only 2 introduced themselves or told me what teams they work on. my phone interviewer called 1.5 hours early and apologized for being 30 minutes late. he told me either get to a computer or the interview is off. he never introduced himself  he hung up during the call for 10 minutes while i coded and called back after i was done. he looked at my answer  asked a few questions for 10 minutes  and then just hung up without a goodbye  i never even got his name  apparently he was happy with my answer though because i got a call back from a recruiter only 20 minutes later. my onsite timing was very poor. my first interviewer went on for over 1.5 hours the next interviewer was upset that he had to wait outside for over 45 minutes and not only didn t introduce himself  but was also happy to take his frustration out during the interview. he took his interview over in time  leaving me only 15 minutes until the cafeterias closed for lunch. therefore we went to a smaller cafeteria which had nothing to drink but water. this would have been fine except after rushing through a meal and desperately needing caffeine  and bathroom  i was not in great shape for the next interview. the first 15 minutes were fine as i wrote 6 different tree algorithms for pre  post  and in order traversals in both iterative and recursive forms. the interviewer then asked me if i likes sudoku to which i replied that i didn t actually know the rules of how it worked. at that point he immediately ended the interview saying he wouldn t have time to explain it before asking his interview question. i was surprised that he didn t want to explain his interview question  but more surprised that he didn t have a backup question either. since we were over an hour over schedule anyway the next person was already at the door and this is likely why he ended after only 15 minutes. i never got his name  team  or had an opportunity to ask a single question  which was also true for the next interviewer. he asked me a classical question that is common in universities. i already knew some of the possible answers and was upfront with him about this. he responded by taking the white board markers and saying he would like to discuss possible answers instead of coding them. after an hour of good discussion we had not written any code at all and he ended his interview. i assume that for the committee this probably did not reflect well since they like to see code. my system design question was interesting and went on for over 3 hours. the interviewer asked me  as a team lead  what do you do when an  expletive  pm is trying to make your team death march  saying he will just replace employees as they burn out.  having been through similar situations at microsoft i was very good about handling this sort of thing in a way that is beneficial for all parties involved. i have to say that i was  and am still  surprised by the question though  by the end of my last interview the recruiter had left so i didn t say good bye to anyone. i was just escorted out.,nda prohibits me from sharing these  but of the 10 or so questions i was asked 6 of them were graphing algorithm related  and 2 of them were discrete math related.   answer question

2015-04-25 00:44:29.963,i was contacted by a recruiter through my linkedin profile. the recruiter had a particular team in mind for me. it turned out i knew some people who already worked there  who highly recommended me  so i was able to bypass a phone screen. i was told i would have to do all of my interviews in either c  c    or java. i didn t know any of these languages particularly well  my professional experience has been more in dynamic scripting languages   so i told the recruiter i would need some time to review java. i managed to drag it out for a number of weeks  but ultimately did not come in adequately prepared for java coding exercises. the interview consisted of four or five back to back one hour one on one sessions with engineers asking challenging algorithm questions. one session seemed more focused on system design. one thing that was very challenging about this interview was its sustained level of intensity over a long period of time. by the time i hit hour 3 or so  i was mentally drained. the other was that i was trying to use a language i didn t know well. in addition  the algorithm questions are obviously just designed to be challenging  and your time is very limited. i did come away feeling like google would be a great place to be an engineer. the interviewers seemed to want me to succeed for the most part.,write some code to parse a particular grammar. the grammar was ambiguous  so you would have to be able to discuss how your code impacted the way that statements in the language would be interpreted.   answer question

2014-02-15 20:46:41.427,applied for google software engineer position online. recruiter contacted me within a week to set up a phone interview. the phone screen was scheduled within week. the interviewer asked about various data structures and general computer science concepts. asked me several questions about queues  and heaps. after that two programming questions  1  traverse array in a spiral order. 2  check if directed graph contains a cycle. in 2 weeks i was contacted to set up on site interview. i asked to schedule interview 3 weeks later  so i could prepare for it. there were 4 technical interviews onsite  one lunch interview  just informal talk with some guy from google glass department   and lastly phd dissertation discussion. first question was in order traversal of bst. i wrote the code. then asked me two check if two different bsts have same inorder traversal. i suggested to store first inorder traversal into vector  and while traversing second bst check if the element values match. i also started suggesting using linked list  or modified recursive approach  but he said to make life easy and go with the simple solution. second interviewer gave me array  with elements first strictly increasing  then strictly decreasing. asked me to find the largest number. i suggested to use binary search. o logn  time complexity  with no additional space required. after implementing the code he asked another question. given infinite doubly linked list  and separate list of elements  which are linked to some linked list elements. find out from the list of elements how many neighboring groups are formed. i suggested to use hashtable  to make look up process quick  and traverse the elements and check if they are neighboring elements. o n  time and space complexity. implemented the code  and time ran out to test if with different cases. third interview was the weirdest. the guy had thick accent and from the beginning became apparent communication was an issue. he gave me system design question  observer class has three methods addobserver    removeobserver    notifyallobservers  . after asking some clarification questions  i suggested to use doubly linked list to keep track of all observers  and hash table to look up the individual observer. then he asked to implement three methods. after implementing the code in java he told me the program would not work. apparently the observer was designed for chrome browser. he went into details when user clicks on mouse and then key press is released. i responded the initial question was very vague and asked for more clarification and precise requirements. i suggested what i would change to go around the problem  but time ran out and didn t get a chance to modify the code on whiteboard. after that i had lunch and came back for fourth technical interview. fourth interview  the guy told me to add two numbers in base 3 system. the input  two base 3 streams provided as string. function should return sum of the two numbers also in string format as base 3 stream. i suggested to convert from base 3 into base 10  add numbers and convert back to base 3. i know how to add two  base 2  binary streams without conversion  since i was under the time pressure i went easy way. i implemented conversion from base 3 to base 10. the interviewer said he was satisfied and wanted me to solve another problem. he gave me file size  and asked me to partition file into chunks  so that each chunk size is power of two  and the number of chunks is minimal. i suggested to find the nearest power of two and obtain absolute value of difference between the original file size  and nearest power of two. then re apply the process until reminder is power of two  1 is 2 0 . there was time pressure  so didn t have time for analysis  just implemented and turned in the code. last interview was phd dissertation discussion. it went alright. most interviews went ok  except the 3rd one  during which i had hard time communicating. within a week recruiter emailed me saying hiring committee didn t want to move forward with hiring.,i didn t feel any of the questions were difficult  i haven t been stuck at any point  but apparently that wasn t enough. i also had chance to look up online the most optimal answers to the questions i was asked. to be honest there is very little i would have changed in my responses.   answer question
2014-03-26 13:04:01.277,my technical screening algorithm problem was challenging enough. i enjoyed that time on solving the problem. at first i had solution with much time complexity and finally i got the best approach to solve the problem. interviewer told me that wast the best solution they are looking for. but i was stuck on the coding part at last moment so i was not selected to go even further. i always thought like how you come up to solve the problems matter rather than the exact code  but that is not true with google. they need perfect code in very short 30 min time. i guess they always missed very innovative and a different kind of software engineer by judging like this way.,string manipulation question and unit test quetstion   answer question

2014-03-19 11:04:05.333,i had applied through their job portal online. i was contacted by the first recruiter in january 3rd week. we exchanged emails  she had me fill out a couple of forms  and then i was handed over to another recruiter. she  in turn  handed me over to yet another recruiter. the recruiter coordination was not good  their responses were all over the place. two recruiters were working in tandem to schedule my phone interview and they managed to convert the interview time from pst to my local time with an 1hr error. this ended up with me waiting for the phone screen call one hour earlier than it actually was. i had given up and decided that the person would not call and then i receive a call 1 hour later. the interview itself was appallingly conducted. first of all  the interviewer seemed to be in a room with a lot of echo. second  he must have been using some kind of phone system on speaker or something similar because i could hear my own voice echoed back. i mentioned this to him twice  since it made it difficult to hear his words with the reverberation in the room blurring his voice and my voice echoing. the first time  he said i must be using a headset and that the microphone was too far away from the mouth. i told him that i wasn t using a headset. he waved it away. the second time  he said the same thing. by then i had given up on the interview. i couldn t hear much  he wasn t helping. trying to decipher the conversation and trying to code simultaneously had become a horrible adventure. besides  he wasn t listening to half of what i d said  be it trying to explain my problem solving method or be it my concern regarding the fact i couldn t hear much over the garble. some of the start off questions  break ice questions  he had asked regarding my resume were pointedly patronizing or so i felt. i understand however that a phone screen doesn t give you enough indicators about these things and i could be wrong. the questions themselves were basic programming  then some threading  concurrency  map reduce trivia questions. i understand many people have the ambition or life goal to work for the company. perhaps to them this process might be forgivable. most interviews probably aren t like this and i might have had something of an exception. i consider it disrespectful of my time and an unwillingness to listen to what i could potentially provide.,the question was on n ary tree data stream. not unexpected  but there was a misunderstanding between myself and the interviewer. the question is to find the head of the tree given a data stream of key value pairs.   1 answer

2013-12-30 09:45:39.257,i applied through a friend at google. i had a 45 min phone interview with a software engineer. he asked for a brief overview of my research and then asked several coding questions. they were average difficulty  similar to the ones on careercup or glassdoor. then  i had an on site interview  which consisted of 4 coding interviews and 1 research interview. the 4 coding interviews went over algorithms and system design. the interviews had a shared document that let them know which topics had already been covered  so it pays to prepare for all of the topics covered in a typical software interview. the research interview was a casual conversation about my thesis research. my advice is to get a coding interview book and do as many of the practice problems as you can on paper.,nothing specific because of nda.   answer question
2014-02-14 12:04:53.713,i was referred by another engineer. i had a very brief phone screen and immediately scheduled an onsite interview after selecting the position to apply for. my first day consisted of three 45 minute interviews. two involved writing code for text string problems  no specific details because of nda . they weren t especially challenging but increased in difficulty and constraints over several iterations of problem revision. no super complicated data structures were necessary  from my impression  just writing very tight code correctly and clean  reasonably rapidly  20 30 lines. and very short discussion of runtime and space. i wrote in c but i have a feeling c   or java was preferred. i explained how such convenience apis  java queue  c   map  etc.  worked under the hood and basically reinvented them in c. i feel a better approach would have been to just use them and mention in passing how they work. my third interview was troubleshooting a site deployment problem. i just isolated components and talked specifically about how i would pinpoint and solve problems related to networking  load  etc. we just went through different hypothetical scenarios and how it affects users  etc. i then had a second round of interviews consisting of three more and a lunch on a separate day. two more coding not entirely different than the previous two. one had much more emphasis on analysis of runtime and different ways to improve and the limits on maximal efficiency. the last interview was large distributed system design for a game  with bits of code and pseudo code and how to design the various components.,No Question

2014-02-21 16:50:02.157,i was first contacted by google in 2012 a couple months after i took up current employment. this recruiter was energetic  interesting and seemed genuinely interested in finding the right spot for me at google. unfortunately  i had just started my new job and have a personal policy of staying at a place of work for at least a year. that  and the project was interesting and exciting so i did not follow up and let him know why. time passed and eventually he moved on from google. about a year later another recruiter contacted me. she seemed nice but nowhere near as enthusiastic. we setup a time to talk over a hangout but unfortunately she cancelled at the last minute. not good  i d changed my plans around to fit. so i agreed to her request to setup a new hangout the next week. nothing happened. after about two weeks  i waited due to work commitments  i got back in contact with her and we worked out a new time and the interview went ahead. she was courteous and seemed reasonably enthusiastic  but nothing like the previous guy who had a specific position in mind. no  this was now very open ended  non specific and i started to feel like just another candidate. despite this i decided to see where it went. so a technical phone interview was setup and it was possible one of the worst phone interviews of my career. i could not hear a thing. the call quality was terrible. this made it extremely hard to hear what i was even supposed to be doing. fortunately  the googler on the other end was very helpful  polite and understanding. we eventually nutted out what he wanted me to do via google docs. then i waited over two weeks for feedback. i passed the interview but then i was transferred unceremoniously to recruiter the 3rd. this guy was even less enthusiastic but communication was clear and to the point. he ignored my request to talk to him over hangout. but  the second interview got organised with a team i was interested in. the second interview however was far worse than the first. call quality was better but still not great. worse still however was the interviewer who  seemingly  had zero interest in being there. he explained what he was looking for  a basic problem  and for the rest of the interview ignored most of my questions. i was trying to talk through the problem  explain what i was doing and also try and see how he would work with me. from what i heard i d expected this from a google interview. and indeed  the last interviewer was great. however  this guy did not answer my questions   aside from some grunts   and seemed more worried that i wasn t using stl. i told him i just wanted to keep it simple as it was a simple question. did i forget to mention that he was a full 15 minutes late to the interview  i cannot stand this and it is disrespectful and very tardy. also  the question asked had nothing to do with the specific position i was interviewing for. in the end  i ve no doubt i gave a sub optimal impression on my second interview. but what do you expect from a sub optimal interview  garbage in  garbage out. so in the end i did not get an offer. while i understand that i am perhaps in the minority here as far as google interviews go i can see from the stats that i am certainly not alone. from my experience i can only conclude that google does not take its recruitment seriously and it has big issues with process.,they were only of average difficulty.   answer question
2015-01-14 21:38:12.443,i applied for the position in a career fair at my university. a couple of months later i got an email from a recruiter to set up an interview. i scheduled an interview for a month later. i had two phone interviews  questions were about my background  coding  and algorithms. i thought i did well in the interview  but a week after the interview i got an email from the recruiter that i didn t get the position.,i thought all the algorithms questions were easy and basic  the coding questions on the other hand  specifically one of them  was not that clear and straightforward. i mostly blame the fact that the interviewer couldn t define the problem in a clear proper manner. he then tried to explain the question via an example but his example was also confusing.   answer question
2014-01-28 12:54:04.22,google s interview process has changed significantly and it s much more streamlined. i had 5 rounds of on site interviews. as always  the questions were challenging but they were more meaningful and  in line with the reality . the whole process was well planned and well organized. all interviewers were in time and wrapped up the interview in time too. of course  there is whiteboard coding but they were not pedantic about every single syntax.,questions were all technical and i m not going to disclose them here.   answer question
2013-12-15 14:27:23.857,i was initially contacted by a recruiter who indicated that i had been referred by someone working there. first he inquired if i was interested to which i said yes. we briefly discussed a phone chat but quickly moved forward with an on site interview. initially  i was to interview at their new york office but the recruiter felt my chances were better if i interviewed at their headquarters in mountain view. so i agreed to a face to face interview at their headquarters. at this point  i was introduced to a second recruiter who helped set up my travel arrangements  discussed what to expect  and answered any additional questions i had. she had also given me a list of topics to study and a couple of websites to visit to help prep. she was the one i met with when i went onsite and she let me get a drink and use the bathroom before heading to a conference room where i would spend the next few hours. she then left me after giving me a chance to ask any more last minute questions. i had a schedule of 3 interviewers followed by a lunch break followed by 2 more interviewers to finish the day. the interviewers were nice and accommodating and happy to answer any questions but were very mindful of the time except for my final interviewer who probably spent 2 hours with me. they gave the impression they are passionate about what they re doing and did not dismiss anything i said as foolish or dumb  i mention this as i ve read other interview accounts who said their interviewers were snobbish and elitist . after about a week  i emailed my recruiter asking about a status. she said they were still waiting on the feedback from some of the engineers and that she would find out where they were with this. about another week after that she called me to inform me they were not continuing with the process. i had tried to find out more about the reason but she said there was no feedback available and that it s a  flaw  in their process. she encouraged me to apply again in another year or so indicating that people often did re apply after their first try.,i had been asked to write a program that would perform a basic regular expression search.   answer question

2013-10-15 10:58:20.227,the hiring process took 2 months. one phone interview and 5 interviews on site. the interviewer acted lost and disinterested. they were also not very organized with questions and everybody forgot to ask me questions related to my resume.,no difficult questions at all. there were some problems that just required a lot of time to carefully walk through.   1 answer
2013-10-07 22:18:03.723,i applied online and got a response from a recruiter almost immediately. after that everything went very slowly. the entire process has taken 2 months and the worst thing   communication with my recruiter was almost completely broken  i did not receive responses for several days  the recruiter scheduled phone calls and did not show up  etc. from the very beginning i had the impression that the recruiter is not very interested in dealing with me. i was treated as a low priority candidate. may be it s because of the lack of internal referrals. i think  i could be a very good match for google  phd with strong math background  excellent gpa  15  years of continuous coding experience  patents  lots of cool research projects i worked on in the past including projects related to the position i was applying for  google s culture fit  strong desire to be a part of google. i did very well during the phone interview and was invited for the onsite part. i think onsite interviews  4  went very well too. what really surprised me is that interviewers asked lots of questions about my experience. problem solving part was not very challenging. this was a little bit disappointing. tasks were routine and not very well though out. solving a difficult problem you have a chance to shine. when you are dealing with an easy problem it s all just about how fast and accurate you are in white boarding. i cannot say i was absolutely perfect  but i am sure i did not fail any single part  although sometimes i experienced problem understanding what the interviewer really wanted to see. interviewers were nice and friendly. i did not have the feeling i was dealing with stars. several times interviewers were even not up to speed with my ideas and my concern is they might not be able to record everything accurately. i was waiting for the feedback for 3 weeks. by this time i already had an offer from a big google s competitor  but i was patiently waiting for the  job of my dream . i don t know what really happened during these 3 weeks. according to the recruiter  she was collecting interviewer s responses. it strange  since it sounds like my case has not even reached the hiring committee. after 3 weeks the recruiter scheduled a call where she told me they would not move forward with my candidature  because  i did not walk through problems well enough . i do not agree with this conclusion  since i got the opposite impression from my interview. my guess   the reason for the rejection was something else. after all i am extremely disappointed. my recommendation to other candidates  think twice before applying for a position at google. it takes too long and the result is very unpredictable. they are not just looking for smart skilled passionate. evidently there are some hidden criteria. and don t trust google s articles and videos about their recruiting process too much. they present their understanding of the perfect recruiting process. the reality is very different. the other advise is try not to spend too much time describing your experience and asking questions. you have only 45 minutes and you will need this time to work on algorithmic problems. i typically had no more than 25 30 minutes left for problem solving and i was usually given 2 tasks. note that coming up with a right idea and implementing the main functionality is not considered a complete solution. for the record they want to see 100  completed code. if you ve run out of time just because the task selected by the interviewer was too large for the timeframe  it s your problem. interviewer is always right. the phrase  did not walk through problems well enough  in my case could easily mean  proposed the right solution for the second problem  but did not finish writing the code in time .,regarding binary trees  stacks and queues all in one question   answer question

2013-10-17 13:37:29.76,i was contacted by a recruiter. i had 1 technical phone interview. then i was invited onsite for 4 interviews. 3 of the interviews were algorithm and code based  and 1 of the interviews was a system design question.,the phone interview i had was fairly easy. it was focusing on string manipulation and of course writing the code in a shared screen was the challenging part.   answer question

2013-09-17 17:09:33.95,there is one guy he words his question quite vague. he is asking if the array list is partially sorted  what algorithm you should use and what is the time complexity. i am asking like do you mean there are several subarrays which are sorted but in total they are not  he said yes. so i offered answer as o log k   k is the number of the subarrays as a typical case of merging sort. but what actually he means is that he is expecting bubble sorts  and his question is actually not partially sorted but some individual elements are not in the correct order  which finally makes me understand when we came to his big coding question instead of screening. i am just a little bit disappointed that he did not have the patience to discuss and clarify with me better  he looks so in hurry in the interview  talks so fast and cannot wait to leave the room and i remembered he even forgot to shake hands before leaving  which confused me a lot.,what is the total number of different valid parenthesis. i mean not to code it out  but to calculate the number.   1 answer
2013-11-12 13:43:30.55,submitted resume online and get contacted for a phone interview. this is the first time google actually response to my application in my 4 year college life. the interviewer is super friendly  and the question is quite reasonable. i ve heard many people saying been asked a non relevant questions by google engineers such as asking a java person about writing garbage collectors using c. but it didn t happen to me. the interview questions are very reasonable. it focus on data structure and practical algorithms. average difficulty. after 2 weeks  i heard back from the recruiter for an onsite interview  and it s the worst part. it takes them more than 2 weeks to find out a date for the interview  which is scheduled 6 weeks after i m informed for the onsite. i understand there re huge amount of people applying google  but the long procedure is not reasonable.  since there s team match after the onsite  which could take another couple month.  therefore  i went for another opportunity. if it s 5 years ago  google might worth for me to wait. but now there re many great companies out there and google is not the single best option anymore.  actually maybe not even one of the best.  in addition  i told the google recruiter that i m not going to continue with them  but i still received interview arrangement from their coordinator several days later. their recruiting system has serious problem.,give a string of words. find anagram words and put them into the same list  then output the list of anagram words lists. input   add  dad  care  race  output    add  dad    care  race     4 answers

2013-09-14 22:47:02.11,submitted resume online and recruiter called me the next day to gather information. i did an onsite interview with five 45 minute technical interviews. it took about 1 2 weeks to get approved by the hiring committee  and the official offer came a few days later. the offer was much lower than my current salary which was shocking and other offers i already had. apparently google is notorious for having low salaries after searching around online at employee complaints. google was completely unwilling to negotiate the base salary or match other offers i had in hand  or even really come close in my opinion . the recruiter was a bit  jerky  and was trying to pressure me into accepting the offer by implying that every other software company was a poor decision to consider. i felt like google s unwillingness to negotiate the salary at all hinted at a larger  big corporate  problem that would likely be an issue throughout employment there. i ended up accepting a job offer at their direct competitors instead which lacks the  big corporate  feel and the hr team was much more pleasant and reasonable in negotiations.,you need to know pretty much everything you learned in your college data structures class. you should feel comfortable coding on a white board and talking about system design. know linked list and graph traversal algorithms.   answer question
2013-09-05 21:21:28.367,i was invited for a round of interviews in the google office in nyc. the recruiter tried to be helpful and gave me the standard resources to prepare for the interview  such as how to code on the whiteboard  algorithms and data structures  pretty basic stuff . i had 6 interviews in 1 day each lasting about 45 minutes with a lunch in the middle. some of the interviewers had very good questions which you can attack from different angles and have a very good discussion  others were quite shallow and pretty much didn t know anything other than a single question they had prepared to ask at the interview. the interview process or questions aren t something out of the ordinary for a tech company. but what i found a little disconcerting is that some interviewers didn t talk about their own job with enthusiasm when i asked them about it at the end of the interview. also i wanted to find out what area or team i d be joining if offered a job but i could only get some general answers. several weeks later the hiring committee finally reviewed my case and decided to not extend an offer. i m not sure how the committee works. are they the same people who interviewed me  what do they remember about the interview after several weeks  strangely i got no negative feedback communicated to me by the recruiter  but no offer either. a little disappointing  however overall i did enjoy the interview experience.,implement memcpy and know how to optimize cases which dont have be copy byte by byte. given a binary tree  and a value  find all possible number of ways that sum up to the given value. behavioral questions... design a global system performance monitoring network  basically know the differences advantages disadvantages associated with tcp udp    answer question

2013-09-16 21:28:20.98,a google recruiter emailed and called me out of the blue and said that someone internal  didn t specify who  had made a recommendation and wanted to know if i was interested in a position. they were very positive and made it sound like they were really interested. the email had mentioned that i had qualifications that they were looking for. the recruiter said the process would take about 5 weeks and asked me some questions. they followed up with scheduling a tech phone interview. the interviewer was very punctual with their call and polite. he asked some relatively obscure questions which i didn t get immediately but did  once i understood what he was asking. he then asked me to code something in the google doc while he was on the phone then  had me code something more after the call was over. i got another call saying that they d like to do another phone tech interview. someone else called and asked some further questions regarding java collections. i d say i pretty much nailed the second interviewers technical questions but  i didn t get any impression that they were interested in me at all personally. the interviewer had me code another exercise after the call. it was fairly straight forward and i feel like i completed it very thoroughly. that s it  they didn t ask me to come in or anything. i got a call from the recruiter saying the committee was looking for someone with different qualifications and maybe some positions will open up in a year. i was a little puzzled by that because they said they contacted me because of my qualifications  but whatever....... overall everyone was very polite  pleasant and positive.,can t say.   answer question

2013-07-19 06:10:58.95,the interview process at google is clearly defined by the recruiter you are working with. i applied via the website following the instructions they have listed and received an email from a recruiter within 24 hours. the recruiter will give you technical resources to review for the interview questions. my first attempt i went through all rounds but did not get extend an offer. i spent most of my effort preparing by searching the web for questions people were asked in the past and reviewing basic concepts. apparently i did well enough for them to call me a year later and ask me to interview again. this time i prepared by reading the recommend algorithm design manual and doing as many practice questions as possible on a white board. i used the practice questions from cracking the coding interview and programming interviews exposed. my advice would be to postpone the in person interviews to give yourself plenty of time to prepare. your gut reaction is to do it asap  but trust me you need the extra time to go over all the material. i gave myself two weeks to prepare and it worked.,i will not break the agreement that i made with google.   answer question

2013-05-09 11:38:12.593,i applied through a friend and was contacted by hr almost immediately. they scheduled me for on site interviews at the mountain view office without a technical phone screen. i arrived early at google s west campus and found parking easily. it took a while to find a non employee entrance to the building i was supposed to go to but i found it and signed in on a computer. the hr person then met me and took me to a conference room where i had two technical interviews  took a lunch break with an engineer who was not interviewing me  and had three additional technical interviews. i can t discuss the specific questions but they were rather easy except one which was moderate. four involved programming on the whiteboard and the last one covered system design. all of the interviewers were courteous and polite but two of the interviewers and the guy i had lunch with were especially warm and friendly. the questions already posted on glassdoor under google are a bit harder than the questions i was asked but they are good preparation. i got one question which was listed here so i admitted that i knew it and gave the answer right away. i didn t get a follow up question so that one was probably a free pass. most people asked questions in three phases. the first part is trivial. the second part is moderate and the third part is moderate or hard depending on your familiarity with the subject area  dynamic programming  recursion  hashtables  etc.  i don t know whether i ll get an offer or not yet but since that s not an option on this form  i ll say that i did and accepted it.,find the maximum sum of a submatrix.   1 answer

2013-05-14 16:37:02.643,interned at google the summer before. loved the place. the team seemed to like me. am graduating. well  let s do interviews  i contacted my intern recruiter asking for a full time job opportunity  and s he quickly referred me to the recruiter responsible for that. since i was a former intern my phone screen was waived  had two 45 minute screens when applying for internship   and my former intern host was asked to provide a feedback. i was asked to do a job talk  as a phd  followed by 4 rounds of interviews  2 research and 2 engineering. the job talk was 45 minutes followed by 15 minute questions. i was basically talking about what i did during the graduate school years  so it was quite pleasant and i was excited to see people interested in my work. after that it was a casual lunch with my intern host  so i devoted every minute enjoying the food. the two research interviews were conducted by people familiar with the field  and had challenging questions on the overall understanding. i found it very exciting as both of us would get involved into discussion about the state of the art. a little coding and math details were asked  but mainly about research ideas. the two coding interviews were very standard   i did not get those very difficult questions like  implement sudoku in 30 mins  that someone allegedly encountered. the interviewer was constantly copying my whiteboard writings down  which created a little down time. i asked the interviewer and s he said it was recently required and no worries. i guess if this could be disclosed by the recruiter earlier it would be better. after the interviews the recruiter followed up promptly  with accurate estimates of when i would get updates. the hiring committee approved the application in a week  followed by the final offer a few days later. overall it is a nice experience and google apparently provides great opportunities.,signed nda so no exact questions  but leetcode would help a lot preparing things.   1 answer

2013-04-26 10:33:45.793,got two emails from a google recruiter based on academic institutions i had listed in my google  profiles. i gave the recruiter a call and he called me back the same day. we had a 20 minute conversation about my current experience and about what i was looking for in a future job. he then said he would like to set up an interview in the next couple of weeks. he also requested i send him a copy of my resume. 8 days later i got an email from an interview coordinator. the interview was setup for 6 days from when this interview coordinator contacted me. the interview was to be conducted over the phone and use a google doc. i sent an email back to the interview coordinator asking if i could setup a google hangout interview instead  since i don t have a headset that attaches to my phone  but i do have a webcam and headset that attach to my computer.  i watched an interview preparation video on the google jobs page that suggested that i have a headset  and not to use speaker phone . the interview coordinator sent me instructions for the google hangout interview  these instructions said the interviewer would contact me with the url for the hangout. i spent the weekend before my interview preparing  i practiced coding every sort and search function  some patterns that i haven t used in a while  etc.  as i finished my undergrad 5 years ago  and expected the interview to be quite academic  based on feedback i ve read on this site. also reviewed oo principles  etc. i thought i would be in pretty good shape for the interview. the time for my interview came around  and no email from the interviewer containing the google hangout link. i figured i would give the interviewer 10 minutes before i took any action. 15 minutes later  still no email. so i emailed my recruiter. i got an email back from him almost immediately saying he would contact the interviewer. i then got an email from the interviewer with the hangout link. i clicked the link and it said i did not have permission to join the hangout. i also noticed the interviewer had not joined the hangout. i then got a call from the interviewer. he said that he hadn t ever used hangout before in an interview and so we should just do the interview over the phone  as that was his preference. i asked him to give me a minute to try to get the audio worked out on my end as his voice was muffled to the point i could barely understand him. nothing i did fixed this  so i asked him if he was on speaker  he said  yes . i asked him if he could go off of speaker because i couldn t hear him. he did and then i could hear him perfectly  but both of us had to hold our phones  which was quite uncomfortable. he continued by saying that he just had one question for me  and that it would probably take me the duration of the interview to complete. he pasted a java function into the google doc  as i am most familiar with java . he explained briefly what the function was supposed to do  but said there were errors in the code and that it didn t currently accomplish the goal and that he wanted me to identify and fix the errors. i won t specify what the code did  but i will specify that it dealt with a domain i was only vaguely familiar with. i started walking through the code with the interviewer to understand the flow of data through the function. the code was quite simple  and with some help from the interviewer identified the first issue. the issue was an incorrect mathematical function. for example the line of code was supposed to produce f x    y  but it was not producing y. the function was not difficult  but i couldn t figure out what the mathematical manipulation of variables should be to produce the desired outcome. the interviewer then went on to say that we had only 15 minutes left in the interview  and that we should move onto to see if we can find more issues. so we stepped through some more code assuming the first issue was working correctly. then i found the next issue  it was exactly like the previous issue. this time the function was a little simpler  but still not something you could solve in less than 5 minutes. i tried a few different things  talking the interviewer through exactly what i was thinking. then the interviewer said that our time was up  but that he would give me an extra five minutes to solve the current function  as i was getting pretty close. in the five minutes  i solved that function. he then asked if i had any questions about google that would be appropriate for an engineer that it was likely the recruiter couldn t answer. i asked two questions and then we ended the call.,come up with a mathematical function that produces f x    y for multiple functions found in a given chunk of code for some random domain.   answer question

2012-11-30 16:44:17.873,have interviewed in person with google several times over the years most recently in nov 2012. have never gotten an offer. i will honor my agreement w google not to reveal specific interview questions  but they tend to be generic computer science type questions. as someone who is at mid career it is disappointing to be asked questions that might be more appropriate for an intern applying for their first summer job. i felt i had a lot to contribute but the interview process doesn t focus on anything besides just basic coding questions. google contacted me by phone for a conversation with a recruiter. the technical phone screen step was waived and i was invited in for an in person interview a few weeks later. five technical interviews plus lunch. i felt i did well on the technical questions but the whole atmosphere of the process seemed a bit negative. when i interview i like it to be with people who are clearly inspired by and excited to work for their company. i just didn t get that sense from these people  they had no passion to work for google. the person who took me to lunch actually made clear to me that he was very unhappy working for google. a positive interview experience is one where i come away from it inspired to work for the company  and then if i don t get the job  it is a disappointment because i won t be working there. with google the disappointment is more that i feel i wasted a day of my time there. i ended up thinking that i would use a google offer  had it been forthcoming  more for leverage in negotiating a slightly sweeter deal with my current employer  where i m actually mostly happy. when i was thinking in those terms even before hearing google s negative decision  it seems clear that google failed in motivating me to want to work for them. upon reflection  my basic take away was that i didn t really interview for a position at google. instead  they conducted a very  very generic tech interview which could just as easily have been an interview for any other tech company  be it another large company or a startup. absolutely zero information was revealed that would allow me to determine whether this might have been a suitable match for me. google seems to be counting on their name and reputation to attract good candidates and they seem to feel they don t have to really put anything into the process themselves. it s hard to feel excited about working for a company when their interview process is just a generic imitation of the interview process at many  many other tech companies i ve interviewed with in my career. speaking only for myself  google s name and reputation will probably always be enough to get me to invest a big chunk of a day with an interview. but google seems to expect more than that  they seem to expect a significant investment of time in preparing for the interview as well. i ll admit i probably didn t prepare as hard as i might have for this interview and that may have been a factor in the outcome. however  as an experienced professional with limited time  i need a reason to believe that the investment of time in preparation is worthwhile. google  unfortunately  gave me no reason to be enthusiastic about the process so that i d put the time in. again  at least in my case  it will take more than just relying on their good name to get me excited about working for them.,can t due to nda signed.   1 answer
2012-12-28 01:10:56.42,had 2 phone interviews  questions were challenging. they were undecided as to whether or not to call me on site so i had to take a 3rd phone interview which went well. at the on site interviews  there were 4 interviewers  very friendly and helpful with guiding me towards a solution. also with two of them i had an open discussion about variations of the given system design  tech problem expansion,design the google search suggestion system. i proposed many solutions so as to show that i can approach the problem from different angles.   answer question

2013-12-17 13:07:41.47,a recruiter reached out to me. had an initial call with the recruiter to gauge my interests and my team preference at google. narrowed down to two teams. had a couple of phone interviews  i guess the first one was on the fence. first phone interview was about api design and algorithm design. second was for designing and coding an algorithm and verbally describe a game design. second one went good enough to make me move to the next step. primary recruiter handed me over to the secondary recruiter. it s clear that the primary recruiters are friendlier and take more time to get to know you better. secondary recruiter didn t seem very enthusiastic. he setup my interview with with members of the two teams i had narrowed down with the earlier recruiter and referred me to a travel agency to setup the travel for the onsite interview. i was booked for a total of 5 interviews  3 before lunch and 2 after. lunch was in google s cafeteria with another employee separate from the interviewers. campus has a very nice college feel to it. interview questions range in difficulty. when they see you are solving questions with ease  they turn it up a notch. i found a very heavy emphasis on graph algorithms in my questions. i was expecting it but not to this level  so better prep for those  esp. graph search algorithms and their variations. lots of code writing on the whiteboard to the point where you run out of space  had to design a data structure with certain properties and the interviewer kept asking for new methods. one of the interviewers had a thick accent and it was very hard to understand him. that was the only interview that i felt going bad because of the communication issues. overall a positive experience. i got to brush up on a lot of things that i had forgotten since college.,test line of sight in a game that accounts for obstacles to determine if the bad guy can see you or not.   1 answer

2012-09-17 13:09:57.593,i was one of 25 people who qualified to onsite round of google code jam in new york. i decided to interview with them on the day before the actual competition. there was no phone interview  since getting into onsite round of gcj is considerably harder than passing phone interview. there were 4 interview in total   each being 45 minutes long. there was a lunch break after the first two. the third interviewer was about 25 minutes late  so they decided to put him after the fourth one. all that extra time i could explore the floor  they even agreed to arrange me a short show around. interview questions seemed rather easy to me   some of the questions seem to have roots in classical programming olympiads problems. they told me in a week  that i did well on the interview  then they sent all my feedback to a recruiter in london  because i wanted to work in zurich  and not in america. there were several more things they wanted to know before they could make the final decision  grades in university  current salary and so on. thus  in about one month after the interview they came up with the offer. it s also worth noting that i am still on my last year in university  so i will only start working in about a year.,nothing seemed really difficult to me and i usually could find some good approach nearly immediately  whiteboard coding took considerably more time than thinking.   answer question

2012-06-01 18:20:36.403,onsite interview narrowly focused on white board coding  even demanding all the details on boundary situations  and showed little interest in interviewee s past experience and skills. most interviewers assumed the role of an examiner and were not engaging or interactive. some were arrogant and did not provide adequate clarification for their questions. the interviewee had no opportunity to learn about the project or get to know interviewers as potential co workers during the onsite interview. once the hiring committee decided to move forward based on the interview feedback  the interviewee did have a chance to meet the hiring manager and the team to discuss potential project.,No Question

2012-03-01 17:41:12.83,you re not going to find my actual interview questions here  i signed an nda and do take it seriously. on the other hand there s plenty of these kind of questions on this site and others. if you can work toward a solution on a good percentage of these  you should send in your resume. the recruiting process is quite slow  involving several stages. i was first contacted by a recruiter  we talked for about 15mn and established a profile of my skillset. this is basically  how would you rate yourself at such and such tasks . the recruiter was very nice and really seemed to be trying to understand where i was coming from  and what i could offer to the company. two weeks later  i had a 45mn phone interview with a software engineer who asked actual coding questions. this was done over a google notebook document  so he could see what i was typing in realtime. i felt that those questions were easier than what i was expecting  we had an extra 15mn at the end  which we used to chat informally about what it s like to work at google  . several weeks after this  i was invited to interview onsite  mountain view . this was the most grueling stage  five back to back 45mn 1 on 1 interviews filled with coding problems of varied difficulty  with a lunch break at one of the restaurants  where the food is free... they ll try to find someone with interests similar to yours to babysit you . some of the questions were not very hard  and were basically checking that i knew what i said i knew. some questions were quite hard  and i had to really pause  think  and explain my thought processes   attack the problem as i could  then try to find better ways to solve it. when i got a bit stuck  some interviewers asked pointed questions  which you really have to take as hints   and some others would just let me sweat on my own. each interview had basically one to three questions problems  some incrementally more complex  building on the previous one  some completely disconnected from one another. this was very stressful to me  probably more than it should have been. if you can keep a cool head and a smile  you re halfway there  the other half is actually giving good solutions. now it s not like the difficult questions are very difficult  they re just difficult enough that you have to work for it. if you are a pretty good programmer  know your cs basics  expecially complexity analysis  and are able to write code on a whiteboard without getting lost  there s no reason not to make it. the language you actually use didn t seem to matter  although if you chose c    you should really know stl  if you chose javascript  you should really know your string and array classes  and so on. be aware that there are many stages of review once you re done interviewing  and that google has an incredibly high rate of false negatives. you may have done well in an area for which you re not being considered  you may have been boxed into a profile which isn t accurate  and so on  so don t jump to conclusions even if you feel you did really well. some of my friends who i would  definitely  rate as better programmers than i am have failed for no good reason  even after being told by their recruiter that they did a good job  so be aware of that. one advice i ll give  do not embelish your resume  don t say you re an expert at something unless you are  you  will  be probed. if they re interested in you  your references  degrees and previous professionnal experience will be thoroughly checked. don t be too modest either  i know of someone who didn t pass the first non technical interview because he rated himself too low on some things. be honnest  and if you d honnestly not rate yourself higher than a 6 or 7 10 at something  don t apply for a position that depends on it. another advice  brush up  go back to your cs basics and do a good number of problems of the kind you ll find here. a month training on algorithms could definitely make the difference between making it and not. i had to wait for over a month before getting an actual answer. the recruiter was not always keeping me informed about the process but to be fair  there s only so many times one can apologize for the time it s taking. also  the way potential hires find their ways to an actual team is a bit peculiar. basically once they know they want you  they still need to find a team that likes your profile  so you may not know until some time which team you may end up with at the end of the process. on the other hand  this gives the recruiter a chance to actively try to find a good fit for you. total time between being contacted and getting an offer  about 3 months. ymmv. in retrospect i had a pretty ging of march. that one started by the engineer unable to call my phone  i had to call him international  and explain how to call me. some 15 minutes were spent there. so finally i got some web system design and scalability questions  that  with guidance mind you  i think i answered successfully. i felt much better after that interview. but weeks rolled by with no response  i was a nervous wreck  so i wrote back asking what the status was  as april was a deadline for h1b   and eventually i got a response that because of the engineer s feedback the process was over for me. i honestly appreciated getting the response  but obviously was not happy. i was taken aback  but what surprised me even more was that engineers that i consider better than myself  were also getting interviews and also didn t get a lot further. the pattern seemed to be people with plenty of experience  10  years   multiple team positions  and a history of leadership as well. a pattern hard to ignore. in the end  like i said  the experience was very life draining  i would not enter into it again lightly. consider a hiring process that takes months and months  unnecessarily  ie. 3 months for 2 coding interviews   that is not a good indicator of the health of the hiring workflow.,splitting a search query between different machines   1 answer

2012-03-23 19:46:54.94,i applied through new graduate program and a recruiter contacted me within a week. i was scheduled for two back to back phone interviews on the same day. i used glassdoor  steve yegge s blogs  and couple of other resources for the preparation along with going through my college data structure course material again. before my first interview  i was quite nervous  which didn t help later on . the interviewer started with some questions about my prior experience. then he gave me a programming question  find the maximum consecutive sum of integers in an array. if i have an array a     1 1 2 3 4 5 0   the sum is 15 but for a   1 2 4  5 10  1  the sum is 16. i asked the interviewer if i could try out few examples on paper but he insisted that everything should be done on google doc which was kinda tough for me as i m more of a design through examples person. my mistake was to start churning out code without properly thinking through the solution and testing it against few examples. my first solution didn t work. my 2nd mistake was to totally switch my approach to recursive from iterative  which didn t turn out well. in the end  i couldn t solve it in time and more importantly  my process for solution was quite embarrassing. by the end of the interview  i knew i had screwed up my chance. for 2nd phone interview  which was 10 minutes after the first  i was quite relaxed for some reason. the interviewer was also very friendly. he asked me some basic questions about my experience along with some questions about hash tables and os concepts. for the programming part  he asked me to implement an iterator class for list of lists. the idea was the give user a seamless experience for iteration while keeping track of multiple lists  which may even be empty. i was able to complete this implement and test this class easily though the interviewer did point out couple of syntax errors  wrong naming convention for java functions . though the 2nd interview went good  i didn t do well at all in the first. after a month of wait  i got the dreaded but expected call that i didn t make it to the next round. i wonder what took them so long to decide.,write a function to get maximum consecutive sum of integers from an array.   11 answers implement iterator for a list of lists which may contain empty lists.   answer question

2012-02-07 09:00:36.74,i was contacted by a google recruiter to first schedule a phone interview. the phone interview was to be held on the phone and through google docs where both the interviewer and i could type in text on the same page. when talking to the recruiter  she asked me what languages i was the strongest in. i responded that my most recent languages were c and matlab. she said that the interview would be in one of these two languages  but that the potential on site interview could be in anything on my resume. my most recent background is in embedded systems development  but to my complete surprise once the phone interview started  the interviewer asked questions in c  . i did answer the initial basic c   question correctly  but i was not prepared to answer the c   questions and i asked the interviewer if she was familiar with my background and if she could switch to c instead. she did. during the interview she asked about software implementation of the cache driver first. we had a detailed discussion about it. then she asked if i was familiar with binary trees. i said that i have heard of them  but never used them  and explained that i have used linked lists in the past and implemented basic search functions on them. we later discussed differences between arrays and linked lists and i answered all her questions correctly. so  in total  of the questions she did ask  i answered all of them correctly and frankly did not find them very insightful or difficult. a week later  i received the call from the recruiter that i would not have any further interviews. citing company policy  she declined to provide specifics. she did say that they were looking for people with broad backgrounds. here is what i think happened. in short  the interviewer s background was completely different from mine. i would not have any issue with that  after all google is a software company  but that is not how the process was explained to me. i was prepared for a completely different type of interview  based on the comments from the recruiter. not only did the recruiter set me up for a different type of interview  the interviewer herself was completely not familiar with my background. there seem to be limited communication between the recruiter and the interviewer and little understanding of my qualifications on their behalf. i feel misled  because i should have not been told by the recruiter that the interview would be conducted in c  whereas clearly the interviewer must have had her eyes set on c  . i would have prepared for a c   interview if it were not for the comments by the recruiter. for sure i would have not asked to switch to c  if i had any inclination that c   were so important to them. the interviewer should have insisted on conducting the interview in c    if it were so important. she should have insisted on my answering the binary tree questions  if they were so important. lessons learned  1. do not take everything the recruiter tells you as 100  accurate. google is now a large company and has large company policies  meaning the recruiter may have very limited communication with the interviewer. 2. be prepared for any type of questions  regardless of your own background. it may not be checked. 3. be prepared for specific skill tests  not only for evaluation of your thinking ability. in spite of google claiming that the interview process is about determining how candidates think  it is apparently not always true. i have iq over 170. my logic in my answers was 100  accurate  but i did not want to discuss issues i was not prepared for. i do not think the interviewer was interested in my thought process or in my thinking capability. it appears that she was merely interested in me solving academic problems that she knew the answers to.,desing a 4 way software cache driver.   4 answers

2011-10-17 14:11:09.13,the interview was really bad. the interviewer was 15 minutes late because she was looking for a phone to call me. no phones available at google  she asked 3 decent questions. but i don t think she was prepared at all for the interview. and i believe she picked these questions online quickly. 1. the classic  what happens when you type  google.com in the browser  dumb and everyone knows the answer. 2. what is the difference between get and post in forms  another dumb question. 3. programming  write code that translate an alphanumerical phone number into a valid phone number. e.g  1 800 go fedex to 18004633339  her example  i could tell she picked that question online and very quickly and probably didn t have a real answer herself. as i was trying to solve the problem  she was picking on little syntax  which even great programmers don t pick up on the first try. with this question  it takes a long time to simply check that the string is long enough and not too short. and then she said you can simply get the alphanumerics i.e  1800gofedex  but of course that doesn t work because someone can write  1800  gofedex  18 00 gofedex  1800 g ofedex. 1  800gofedex  1  800  gofedex  etc... so going through these cases alone takes a long time not 10 minutes especially when she was late. as i pointed out how crazy it would be to write actual codes  she said time was over. she definitely didn t have any clue how that problem would be solved.,what happens when you type  google.com in the browser   1 answer difference between get and post in forms.   2 answers write a program to translate alphanumeric phone number to numbers only   6 answers

2011-11-03 05:18:20.11,the process went quite well. the first phone interview was easy and straight forward with data struct design  coding and some questions which did not require exact answers. the second phone call was delayed two days after the first one because my interviewer was occupied in a meeting that day. the second interview went well as well but i was asked some questions on multi thread  i solved it with some endeavors. then the interviewer seemed not prepared for another question following the first one. anyway he spent some time pulling another simple coding question to me and i finished it within 3 minutes and the interview was done. 3 days later the recruiter emailed me and told me that i ve passed the interviews and was moving to intern host matching stage  which might take more than 3 weeks. and now i m going to have a talk with my recruiter and she then will give my profile to those intern hosts.,i won t disclose those questions due to nda but i m gonna tell you they were not difficult. just show yourself. maybe you can find those questions on glassdoor  i m not sure. i ve gone through the first 15 pages but i did not find any match.   answer question

2011-08-27 16:51:47.483,i had always wanted to work at google  but i never thought i would get in. i m 45 years old and i have a 2.2 gpa. my friend at google submitted my resume and i waited quite a while before i got a rejection letter. in retrospect  with them receiving 3000 resumes a day  it must be very easy to get lost in the shuffle unless your resume really stands out  and mine certainly did not. i waited a while and then contacted google again and asked them to reconsider my resume  and they did. from that point on  it was an amazing process. right away i got an email asking when would be a good time for a recruiter to talk with me  hr screen . i said   if not now  when   and 60 seconds later i got a call from the recruiter. we talked for 45 minutes and mostly it seemed like just fun chitchat. she asked about my experience and what i liked to work on and what languages i preferred. then she said she would find an engineer suitable for me and would call me back soon. she called the next day and we scheduled a phone interview  tech screen  for the following week. she also send me an email about what to expect and things to brush up on. the next week i got the call from an engineer. we worked together in a google doc  and on the phone. he asked me about my resume  particularly my machine language experience. then we did a bit manipulation problem  and i missed an obvious optimization. then he asked me the main problem which was very clever. i came upon the solution very quickly  using recursion  but i screwed up on the complexity analysis. afterwards  we chatted about google life. it was a fun experience  but i figured i had blown it. i got a call from the recruiter an hour later telling me that the feedback was positive and that we would move on to the on site interview. i spent a month in front of my white board practicing problems  especially from gayle laakmann s book  cracking the coding interview. i read through introduction to algorithms   but there was just too much information in there to cram into my brain. at one point i was worried about my low 2.2 gpa and asked if i would be given a chance to explain the situation. i sent them an email and 30 seconds later one of the recruiters called me and said  basically  no one cares about your gpa. i get the impression that it s just a metric they use if there s nothing else on your resume to judge you by. i am not going to describe the interviews here. sorry. not only did i sign an nda  but i also don t want to spoil it for anyone. i will just say this much  those people who said   they asked me a simple cs101 question and i answered it and they still didn t hire me  those arrogant pricks    well  dude you completely missed the point of the exercise. it s really not about getting the  right  answer. the interviewers were all very cool. some were reserved  and some were friendly and outgoing. i had a very fun time  but i missed a lot of simple things  didn t complete all of the problems  made simple syntax errors  and completely fumbled the interview that focused on java. i left depressed  but feeling like i had been given a very fair chance. i got a call from a recruiter two days later saying that the interview feedback was  pretty positive  and that he decided to forward it to the hiring committee. the following monday the hiring committee gave me a  unanimous thumbs up . another recruiter emailed me to say she would be contacting my references and my application would go through the compensation committee and the executive committee. i was given a questionnaire to fill out  asking about past employment details and such. it also asked about any past achievements i may want the executive committee to know about. they said i would probably hear something in the next few weeks. getting close to the end of the two week period  at 10 30pm  i got the email to  extend me an offer . when i replied to the email  she saw i was still awake so she called me on my cell phone at 11pm to give me the details as soon as possible. and the details were very generous  so i did not negotiate. overall  it was an awesome experience. everyone was super nice and polite. the whole thing took two months  but a month of that was me asking for time to prepare. i ve heard of cases where they can push it through in two weeks if you re really in a hurry. they kept asking me if i had any time constraint that they needed to work with. also  yes  i asked  and larry page did review and sign off on my final approval. from his own words  he s gotten so good

2011-09-16 18:40:00.407,i ve been contacted by their recruiters every 6 months or year for the past 6 or 7 years. finally i was in the right place in my career to actually interview there  so i agreed. the first step was a phone interview. the recruiter suggested a whole lot of studying material. i kinda ski their new york office. i was already employed in a good job at the time  so i was in two minds about exploring new opportunities. they set up a meeting for me with one of their engineers to clear any doubts or questions i may have about working at google. this really helped with my decision to interview there  and i indicated to the recruiter that i would like to go ahead and interview with them. an on site interview was scheduled within three weeks. the interviews started at 10 00am at the google offices in manhattan  since i live in the area  i didn t need to travel  etc.   and were over by 3 00pm. there were 1 on 1 interviews by five of their engineers  each lasted about 45 minutes. one hour was set aside for lunch at the google cafeteria  where all of the food is free and awesome   and one of their engineers was assigned as my  host  at the lunch to answer any questions i may have about life at google. he also gave me a tour of their offices  which is very cool . all of the interviews were conducted in an  interview room  at the google offices  which is a small meeting room consisting of a single  small  round table and a couple of chairs  a whiteboard and writing supplies. the interviewers  promptly  came to the room at their scheduled times and conducted their interviews for their 45 minutes  or until the next interviewer had arrived outside. each of the interviews consisted of one or two math or algorithm problems. i was expected to first describe my general approach to the solution. after the interviewer was satisfied with the general approach  i was asked to write code on the whiteboard. i could use any programming language of my choice. i chose java in almost all questions  and it seemed that most of the interviewers did their day to day work in c  . in any case  about half of the time was spent in the back and forth with the interviewer in coming up with the general approach to the problem    i would come up with an approach  and the interviewer would point about certain cases that didn t work  or other conditions that needed to be met . the other half of the time was spent in planning and writing out the code on the whiteboard. despite my background in research  none of the questions pertained to my background and experience. the questions were all designed to gauge fundamental problem solving and algorithms expertise. it seemed like the interview questions were devised completely independently of my resume background. finally  during the last 15 minutes  2 45pm 3 00pm   i had a short  debrief  session with the hr guy  who gave me the opportunity to ask him any final questions i may have had  and to give him a little feedback about my experience that day. overall it was a good interview experience    very professional  all interviewers were well prepared  punctual and respectful.,you are given an function which converts a string like  i work at google  to  google at work i . write all the test cases you can think of for testing such a function.   1 answer you are given a random binary tree 5     4 9         3 5 6 8 write code to print it out in order level ie 5 4 9 3 5 6 8 the tree need not be balanced. write all the datastructures for the tree and make sure that you print newlines after each level. also write test cases to test your code.   4 answers

2013-10-21 08:07:58.027,i had previously been offered a job back in 2003 out in mt view but did not want to relocate. then i saw a blog post that they were hiring locally in nc and so i reached out to the poster. first had coffee with the guys and then initiated the normal hiring process through a hiring manager. first interview was at the local office with two different engineers. this went well. followup interview was out in mt. view   standard google interview with three engineers   two from the group i would be working with  graphics  chrome  one from outside. interviewers were professional and cordial to friendly. i struggled a bit with the graphics algorithms questions as this is not my area. i did not get an offer this time   i don t think i was a good technical fit for what they were looking for in the nc office  small only 10 people working on graphics . i did not get any detail about the  no  from the recruiter  but i don t expect that typically you get much. the only snafu problem i had was an awkward situation where i was asked the same question by two different interviewers  see below .,how does the garbage collector in the jvm work and how does it reclaim orphaned objects    1 answer explain pointer arithmetic   answer question what guarantees does the synchronized keyword give when used on a method  when a thread calls the synchronized method  can another thread call a method that isn t synchronized on the same object    1 answer
2011-05-17 13:21:47.887,i applied online for a job opening for software engineer at google new york and was contacted straight away by a very friendly recruiter. we talked over the phone about the google culture in general  the position and my experience. also had to rate myself on a scale of 1 to 10 on my programming language of choice  java . a date was set for a technical phone interview. i read up on my cs basics  my core programming language and some google whitepapers. a software engineer contacted me at the exact agreed upon time. no small talk  straight to business. first question was about garbage collection in java. interviewer was looking for a very specific answer which i more or less could give. next question was about memory leaks in java and how to cause them. i wasn t aware of any way to do that  but apparently the substring method on a string object can cause it  first time i ever heard of it... then he asked about pointer arithmetic. i gave him a generic description but he was looking for more detail. i explained that an array reserves a memory block where in principle one could use pointer arithmetic to get the next memory block reserved for an index in the array. by this time i got the sense that this was a c c   programmer proving the superiority of his language of choice over java. then he asked about the synchronized keyword s use on a method what guarantees it gives and how it behaves under different usecases  no problems there. next came the programming task that i needed to resolve in a shared google doc document. i had to implement encode   decode methods that would serialize deserialize a binary tree. i didn t analyse the problem enough in advance and assumed he meant a balanced binary tree. after a while he gave me a hint that i was on the wrong track. i started again and got 2 3 through the exercise when the interview time was up. all in all i felt i didn t give a good impression  although i felt the questions weren t a good gauge of my skill level. the impression i got from the interviewer was pretty negative. it felt like he thought he was wasting his time from the beginning. not a nice feeling. i sent an email to the recruiter explaining my impressions of the interview. after a few days i got an email from the recruiter tell me they wouldn t be continuing the interview process. oh well  their loss...,a bst question.   answer question a string manipulation question.   answer question a simple bigdata question.   answer question bfs  dfs  and interval trees   answer question os and compiler related stuff.   answer question

2011-05-26 23:17:25.613,got called by the recruiter and scheduled for on site interview. the recruiters are very nice to work with. during the interview  i met with four interviewers and all of them asked data structure and algorithm related questions. no single question was related to my own background or achievements. one of the interviewers was difficult to communicate. three others were sharp  nice and patient. a few days later i was told that i didn t get the offer because the interviewers didn t reach concensus on hiring.,data structure and algorithm related questions.   answer question
2011-05-19 14:43:13.77,i was first contacted by a recruiter. my interviews consisted of 2 phone interviews  45 mins each  and on site interview with 4 engineers  45 mins each . the questions were mostly coding questions  but i also talked about my research in some of the interviews. overall  questions were not that hard and i thought i did a decent job  so i was really disappointed to hear that i couldn t get an offer.,not allowed to disclose by nda.   answer question
2011-06-06 11:13:04.62,i was contacted by a recruiter from google southern california  irvine and santa monica  through linkedin and was asked if i had any interest in applying to google. i replied yes and then had a phone call with the recruiter  about 40 minutes  to talk about my background and experience  and the recruiter talked about the interview process and answered all my questions. the recruiter was amazingly nice and very easy to talk to. the first thing i had to do was choose an office to apply to. i chose santa monica and asked for 2 weeks to study before the first phone interview. two weeks later i had the phone interview. i was very nervous but my nerves calmed down as soon as i started talking to the interviewer  he was friendly and the interview felt more like we were a team working on a problem together rather than an interview  to some extent . it was very casual and the problems were interesting. the interviewer gave me a few tips and clues when i got stuck  but overall i felt like i did pretty well. one week later  the recruiter contacted me to announce i passed the phone interview and was invited to an onsite interview at the santa monica office. the onsite interview was scheduled for a week after that  so 2 weeks after the phone interview . i arrived at the building  but they have 3 buildings and i showed up at the wrong one  way to make a good first impression  i felt so stupid. so if you have an interview there  make sure to follow the directions they give you by email instead of googling  google santa monica  for the location. the onsite interview consisted of five 45 minutes 1 1 interviews back to back with a lunch with an engineer in the middle. four of the interviewers were male software engineers in their early 30s  one was older  50s . all of them were nice and friendly and made the experience very pleasant. all but one of the interviewers made me feel like i was already part of the team and that we were just working together on a problem. the lunch was a little more awkward. the guy was older than me  50s  so we didn t have much in common  i am in my late 20s  and he was very hard to talk with. i had some questions and conversation topics ready to make sure the lunch would go smoothly  but i ran through all my questions in about 10 minutes because he only answered with  yes    no   or a few words. he never asked me anything or made any effort to keep the conversation going. you could tell he was a nice guy  nothing wrong with him  just not a talker. seems like a weird choice for a interviewee lunch  the whole thing felt like an uphill battle against awkward silence. the lunch was probably the most stressful part of the whole interview day  at the end of the day  i left the onsite interview feeling confident and happy. the problems had all been interesting and i really did enjoy most of the interviewers. one week later i received an email from the recruiter saying i was not selected for the job. i think i did pretty well  i guess i was not quite quick enough with my answers.,they made me promise not to tell. there were questions about thread safety  computational complexity  and dynamic programming. also other questions.   answer question
2011-05-02 13:21:58.423,a google recruiter cold called me on 3 feb 2011  i guess they got my r sum  from an old co worker   and i was kinda bored so i aksed her to send me more info about the job. the recruiter sounded eerily stoked on both the company and the project  kept describing it all as  exciting  . by the end of the next week we had scheduled a phone interview for 22 feb.  i wasn t in any sorta hurry . then i rescheduled the phone interview for a week later  1 mar. shared google doc  the interviewer pasted some code and aksed me to find bugs in it and repair them. some other question i don t remember. the topics were like race conditions in multi threaded systems or something. it was nothing shocking  and the interviewer seemed to have a more muted stoke about working for google. two days later  the ultra stoked recruiter called back with a second recruiter to invite me for an in person. the second recruiter sounded pretty hepped up on the brand name too. i think the second was a more senior recruiter. we scheduled an interview for 2 weeks later  17 mar. they put me up in a hotel in mtn view. the hotel was perfectly fancy  and had lots of nerd themed items in the desk in the room  think weird rubik s cubes  puzzles made of heavy wire   c . next morning i woke up and drove to the googleplex. it was pretty  with ample parking  and a kinda agrestic setting. flowers  vegetables  nerds. i waited in building 43 and watched people come in and out. it was easy to tell the difference between the home team and the visitors    the googlers were the ones who looked super jazzed  and the others looked uneasy. i mean  noticeably super jazzed. the senior recruiter came  round and took me to the first interview room. i d been scheduled for three interviews  but he told me they had found a fourth interviewer and would i mind staying longer for more probing.  i said i wouldn t mind.  the first interviewer came in  aksed a question about like statefulness in distributed systems or something  i wrote a big long answer on the board. he was mellow  genial  and helpful. the interview question wasn t too hard  and afterwards  when prompted  he expressed satisfaction with the company. he left  and another helpful  genial  and mellow engineer came in and aksed me some more basic cs stuff  and a question about how to build the back end of a particular google product. she also expressed contentment with google as a place of employment. the guy who gave me the phone interview came and took me to lunch. we went to yet another building for my next interviews. a frankly kinda stressed out seeming engineer aksed questions about code prettification  namely  how to prettify the java code i wrote on the white board. she took me to the next interview where a young guy aksed me a question about c language bit twiddling  and aksed a question about dynamic programming. my undergraduate cs courses were like 18 years previous  and i drew a blank. after futzing around w  it for a bit  time was called and i drove home. i sorta figured that it would end there  so i wasn t suprised when they didn t call back. two weeks later though  the senior recruiter called back to tell me they almost had all the interview reports  and that they just needed one guy s report before making a decision. three days later  around 5 apr  both recruiters started calling me and emailing me. i ignored them for a while  then finally phoned them back. they said they wanted me to talk with a few potential teams there to see if we could find a match. over the next two weeks i spoke with six or seven folks  engineers and managers both. the tone of the calls went from testing my domain awareness to openly soliciting my membership in their teams. eventually  over the course of about a week  the recruiter reported the progress of my hiring order from hiring committee to i guess a second hiring committee to some kind of executive committee to the compensation manager to the executive approval  then they phoned me to tell me the nitty gritty of the job offer. it was pretty good  so i accepted.,google asks interviewees to not share specific details on interview questions. they were coding oriented questions. they required a varied set of algorithms and data structures to solve  especially including graphs  heaps  linked lists  and hash tables. sorting algorithms were also emphasized. some of the interview questions were quite unique  but could be abstracted in neat ways. google does provide a significant amount of material before the interview s  to help you study  including links to reading material and the types of questions you can expect. they were relatively difficult  but the interviewers were helpful.   1 answer
2011-04-27 12:38:51.85,the google interview process typically includes a phone interview or two as well as an on site  in a process that takes a couple of weeks to a month. i had a pending offer from another company  so they expedited my interview  skipped the phone   and expedited the hiring committee review. i got flight info for two days later  flew out  interviewed the next day  friday   and had an offer by monday. at the on site interview  they put you up in a pretty nice hotel and provide a rental car. gps is recommended  as the mountain view   sunnyvale suburbs can be difficult to navigate. the google campus is simply spectacular. they have dozens of buildings  with bikes for transportation between bulidings  buses in and out of different neighborhoods  multiple dining cafes  multiple gyms  etc. google is also located all over the country  and world    you can actually pick your location if mv suburbia isn t your cup of tea. projects teams are distributed across separate offices. as for the actual interview  5 separate 45 minute interviews with other software engineers. the interviewers come from a wide background  infrastructure  front end  etc . questions were all technical in nature  mostly coding oriented. they did ask pointed questions about previous experience  projects  general resume stuff  etc. the interview questions were well thought out and relatively innovative. the interviewers presented them clearly  and were very helpful in discussing solution possibilities. some of the questions were pretty straightforward  but the trickier ones were excellent   we were able to devise solutions and optimize them multiple times  discussing what was better about different approaches. everyone i talked to was very upbeat  intelligent  and nice. the last interviewer i had seemed a bit surly at first  but quickly warmed up and became very affable. the hiring process was very informative. the recruiters gave loads of information when asked  and were very up front about a lot of aspects of the company. the interviewers themselves were able to answer many questions about the gritty details of working at google. the hiring itself is actually done by a separate group of people from the interviewers  and is decided somewhat up the chain of command.,time series addition   answer question

2011-03-08 14:57:36.733,came in for an on site interview. the front desk and recruiter were very nice. was shown around for a five minute tour of the office. the office decor was typical dot com stuff like cube toys  decorations  and a focus on showing your uniqueness and how much fun you re having at work. after the tour we went straight to the interview room for the mini interviews. the interviewers were all software engineers. despite being asked to pick top competencies  the interviewers ignored this  ignored the resume  ignored even basic background questions  and jumped straight into algorithms questions. we would progress through several problems until the interviewer found one which i didn t know off the top of my head. at one point i was asked to derive an efficient parallel multi core algorithm on the spot and the point of the interview was revealed as  stump the applicant.  despite explaining the algorithms  the interviewers insisted they be written out long hand on a small whiteboard without regard of how long was left in the interview. one interviewer revealed that interviewers were allowed to come up with their own problems whether or not they had considered the solution. interviewers provided zero feedback  and once time ran out the interviewer proclaimed  this interview is now over  and left the room. one interviewer claimed that any extra time left over would be  rewarded  with the ability to ask him questions about the job or environment. this is indicative of the office attitude. overall it was a very negative experience and it was conducted more like a contest than a two way sharing of information. i got very little out of it except a reminder of what 90 s era dot com interviews were like.,as per the nda  applicants have to agree not to reveal questions. however  interviewers will progress rapidly through questions until they find one you don t know  so prepping answers won t help. frankly  algorithm trivia is a dumb way to pick employees.   answer question
2011-02-20 19:01:30.063,a recruiter got in contact with me. he was extremely friendly and excited to help me. he sent me interviewing tips and a cheat sheet of what to expect. i had 3 phone interviews and 4 one on one interviews  on site . all of the interviews were extremely well prepared. all interviews stayed exactly or less than 45 minutes. they seem to be very strict as to the duration of each interview. so if there was a tip i would give  it is to not talk too much and let the interviewer ask his questions so you have more time to solve the technical problems. in the end  this is what will matter. i would study up on at least the following  bfs  dfs  hashtables  string manipulation  trees. for my level  3 years out of college  i did not find the algorithm questions to be anything that would be too hard. they are all answerable within 45 minutes. the key is to be able to understand the problem and identify an efficient solution as fast as possible. also  the implementation is very key. knowing to use bfs is not enough  you need to be able to implement it very fast too. i cannot provide you guys with the exact questions because i respect google s nda. however  the following are the kinds of questions that i was asked. i think as long as you are able to comfortably and accurately answer those types of questions in 45 minutes you will be fine  i usually get asked 2 algorithm questions in a 45 minute session .,asked several questions about graph traversal. bfs and dfs.   answer question asked a question about set theory. be able to efficiently compute union  intersection  etc.   answer question asked several questions about analyzing strings  e.g. longest common suffix .   answer question asked questions on anagrams.   answer question

2011-03-12 15:29:25.777,january 2011  mt.view campus visited google first 5 years ago  that time was rejected. this time contacted by recruiter again  offered to come for the interview again. sweeping silicon valley rumor mill brought several facts about interview practices   each interviewer has to submit rather detailed report to the hiring committee recording after you everything written on the white board and allegedly even recording what you say. sometime 2 interviewers are talking to the candidate  in such cases second person is a trainee. sometimes there are two rounds if google is uncertain. candidate has to select programming language of preference for the interview  my choice was c as i was applying to what recruiter called  kernel  positions in chromeos team . was first met by the recruiter  he spent 10 mins with me  i asked about the practices above  even though he confirmed  but downplayed  exact recording of what candidate says part . answered that written report on a candidate is about 1 2 typed pages on average. total met 6 people  5 technical  one lunch first interviewer  1. general discussion on testing methodologies  why unit tests might fail   2. asked me to code review some c   code even though i explicitly selected that my language of preference is c. couldn t say much as i don t use c  . 3. asked to implement c   method for a class  arbitrary reader  given we have a class 4k reader which can read only 4k blocks. second interviewer  1. given two binary search trees  write function which tells if two such trees are the same    i.e. same info in the nodes  same branching to left and right at every node . recursive implementation was presented. was asked to do non recursive version  question was not about better solution  say  w constant memory    i proposed to change recursive algorithm to non recursive with a user defined stack  formal transformation rather boring but doable  fortran people do it . demonstrated that but code was messy with gotos  etc. asked about complexity   both recursive and non recursive versions required linear stack in worst case of pathological one sided trees. third interviewer  1. reverse bits in 32 bit integer. 2. given two large files with 64 bit integers produce file with integers which are present in both files and estimate o    complexity of your algorithm. proposed solution of splitting both files in n chunks  k integers in each  and solving n 2 subproblems while incrementally updating the result by merging sorted files of partial results  we will need to sort each chunk once . after algorithm was finalized  we checked the complexity and it was something cubic by n and k. too bad. navigated me to the solution to sort both files and find intersection by merging  this was better. as an afterthought i still think that when files do not have large overlap my solution might be winning as sorting original large files is not required  k should be selected so that each chunk could be sorted in memory  how about n k sqrt file size    . 3. one has a stream of queries coming over a day  how do you keep a cache of 1000 most frequently used ones  did not have time for this one. fourth interviewer  1. asked light technical questions on past items listed in resume. 2. when you are doing  read    call what it happening under the hood in user space   answer needs to clarify how it is translated to a system call by libc . 3. how to find a median in a large file of 64 bit integers. i mentioned first the classical  order statistics  algorithm with splitting initial group into 5 tuples and finding median of medians  etc. my proposal on the problem was toadopt median algorithm to the case when we are dealing with large file   however no additional disk space could be used  it should be done  in place  and it is not clear for me if order statistics algorithm could be done easily with such restriction. interviewer downplayed the order statistics deal and navigated me to the solution that i liked   keep in memory counters for binary intervals practically counting occurences of prefixes  say  24 bit prefixes . after that we are able to tell what prefix range the median belongs to  recalculate index of the element to search instead of median and go over the particular prefix range and find it there. sweet. after two week got rejection as not matching with current open positions.,given two binary search trees  write function which tells if two such trees are the same    i.e. same info in the nodes  same branching to left and right at every node .   6 answers

2012-04-22 11:02:26.897,i was cold called one day by a google recruiter. i initially indicated that google wouldn t be a good fit because i didn t want to live in california  but he mentioned other offices  including the one in boulder. colorado is pretty similar to my home state of utah. the first part of the interview was a one hour phone interview. during the interview i was asked to solve a series of technical problems  including describing algorithms and providing big o complexities. the questions started out fairly simple but rapidly increased in difficulty and complexity. the second part was a day long in person interview. google flew me to boulder for it. i had five one hour interviews  each similar to the phone screen  except for the middle one which wasn t really an interview... it was lunch  with a chance to discuss the company with a googler  as it turns out  my lunch  interviewer  is now my manager  so it was a great chance to get to know him . after the interview  it took about two weeks to get an answer from google  and another week to get an offer. that was strange to me  in my experience decisions and offers usually come quicker. i ve since learned how the process works  and because of the structure of the process  my experience is typical. the offer was so good that even though my family wasn t excited about moving to colorado  there really was no question. i ve since learned that very  very few people turn down google s offers.,imagine you are creating a program that can handle multiple requests at a time and respond to them as they come. define run time  classes  and methods.   1 answer

2011-05-11 22:27:45.03,the process was long and arduous. first  got a recruiter screen with typical hr stuff. then  after about 2 weeks  got a phone screen with an engineer. i needed to write code on a shared document while talking to the guy on the phone. then the recruiter suddenly changed to a  senior recruiter  and the new one must have been the lousiest senior recruiter they had at the time. he forgot to schedule the onsite  never called or emailed back  rarely picked up the phone when called directly. after more than a month from the phone screen i finally went to the onsite interview. that went fairly well but due to the recruiter not doing his job hiring committee wanted more information. after another month i went back for another onsite. when i heard nothing for more than 3 weeks i asked to change a recruiter. change was approved and after one more onsite i was extended an offer. engineers performing the interviews were all professional and nice  no one asked any brain teasers etc. all questions were highly technical  on par with what i expected from reading glassdoor and other sources. it would be a generally positive experience if it wasn t for the lousy  senior  recruiter.,No Question

2010-11-07 10:22:24.2,i greatly anticipated this interview. many engineers  including me  wants an opportunity to work with the best and the brightest. but the interview went wrong in many ways  and it changed my mind about wanting to work at google. the on site interview was 3 sessions 45 minutes each. 1  the recruiter was incredibly slow. it took almost three weeks for the on site to be scheduled. he often promised to get back to me tomorrow  then i don t hear from him for 5 days. it was frustrating working with him. but i kind of expected this since my friends who interviewed before had similar experience. 2  the first interviewer had a strong accent. i couldn t understand him so i had to ask him to repeat many times. i felt like i was being rude  but thinking back  his inability to explain the questions was cutting into my time to answer them. then he asked me to review some c   code. wait a minute  i am a java programmer and the recruiter said the interview will be conducted in java. the last time i used c   was 7 years ago. i explained it to him  but he insisted  i gave it my best shot while struggling with syntax. 3  the second interviewer was arrogant and rude  he seemed like he didn t want to be there. again  asked me to code a problem that is only relevant in c  . i gave it the best answer in java. he argued with me that it will not work  then i had to explain to him null assignment in java also deallocates a variable because of gc. he wouldn t admit he was wrong  so he made a degrading comment about how java programmer knows nothing about memory management. then he asks a harder question basically requires putting everything in a hashmap then check for a match. he rudely interrupts me while i tried to explain my thoughts. at one point  i literally got a little angry. i happen to be a pretty patient and none confrontational person. i think he had a canned answer in mind  and he didn t want to listen to anything else. 4  the third interviewer was 7 minutes late  but he was nicer. he seemed cocky about working at google. many things he said started with something like  at google  this is how we do... . the questions he asked was a little confusing. i had to ask many follow up questions to understand it. if they are looking for someone with c   skills  then why waste half day of my time. after meeting these interviewers  i recognized that my friends  who work at google  have the same arrogance. the same arrogance a microsoft recruiter once shown me when i first graduated from college. look at where they are now. google is on track to become just like them. if this is what google represents  a prestige driven egotistic cult  then i don t want to be a part of it.,remove a node from a singly linkedlist without knowing the head node. all you have is the node itself.   5 answers find a sequence with max sum in an array of negative and positive real numbers.   14 answers

2010-11-27 21:26:15.38,google recruiter picked my linkedin profile and contacted me. initial phone conversation with her was followed by the first phone interview with a manager  each manager i talked to stressed he was totally hands on  just like other developers  plus carried managerial responsibilities . i d say this was probably true based on the types of questions he asked. he mostly asked me about my current and past jobs  projects  accomplishments  approaches to design  team work  etc   pretty much  traditional  relaxed semi technical interview questions. this one went extremely well  as per my recruiter s feedback. the next one also went well   now with the team lead for the group they wanted me for. a few design questions  one technology question  what do you think of using technology x for solving the problem y  . plus one pretty simple algorithm that i was asked to explain on the phone  although my recruiter initially told me about coding using google s online collaborative tools. it was awkward to just  talk  through the algorithm  instead of writing and talking as i normally do. finally  on site interview. they said they would only have four people to interview me  plus the fifth one would take me for lunch and answer any off record questions. bummer   i thought there would be more people  meaning more challenges  but also more chances to show my skills. four people seemed too few. personal interviews turned into a problem right away. first  no one cared about my professional career and accomplishments. took me off guard   is it because they think it s irrelevant to google  in any event  it s their way  so having figured out their style in the first half an hour i tried just to accept it and move on. the second problem turned out to be a killer  in most cases i totally misinterpreted the intent and scope of their questions  and i am still not quite sure if was my fault. one guy asked to sketch the design of some distributed system. i enumerated all the typical issues   distribution  scalability  database synchronization  etc and how to approach them. the guy kept asking more questions  but i thought he was not satisfied and had no clue why. finally   after good half an hour  he said he basically just wanted me to write the algorithm  that would perform the core function of the entire system  which was computing some stats on the data collected in real time by that very distributed system. all the challenges of distributed systems design turned out  not  to be what he was after  why not to scope the question clearly from the beginning  i gave the best shot at the algorithm  which was trivial  compared to the types of algorithms i do at work. by then i was slightly pissed off by what happened  so i got the right answer pretty slow by my own standards. it almost appeared as if i spent the whole interview trying to write one trivial algorithm  in that and some other questions  i should have basically ignored much of their content  focusing instead on identifying some core algorithm working on idealized data sets   while the way questions were stated would make you think that the core was designing distributed systems collecting such data  one week later recruiter told me they d passed on me due to insufficient algorithmic skills   with the algorithms as simple as the ones asked  that was pretty ironic. i was told everyone liked me on all other accounts  and that the recruiter will contact me in 6 to 8 months to re try the whole thing. i am not sure if i want to pursue it  but i might. having known what i know now  not specific questions  but the expectations behind them   i would ve  probably  passed that interview easily. the take out lesson for me   they are into algorithms and little else  even for senior positions. when approaching their questions  try to start with some simple algorithm expressing the core idea  and ignore everything else   even if this  everything else  constitutes the main challenge in real life development  if you just write this algorithm down correctly  you score. if their question was more involved  they will probably tell you  but you ll score anyway. regardless of whether i personally think that google s interviewing practices are conducive to hiring the best people  i don t   it is their way  so you just have to accept it if you want to get in.,most questions were the typical  contrived algorithm problems  but a couple were more open ended design questions. there was one problem that involved graphs. after giving a solution  they ll ask what the asymptotic complexity is  and how that can be improved. i was also asked what test cases i would write against the solution.   1 answer

2010-05-17 19:40:39.173,i was contacted directly by a recruiter  we exchanged a few emails and talked for a few minutes about past experience  skills  interests  etc. after i agreed to continue with the process  i had a phone interview  an on site interview  was told that they ll contact my references and then received the offer. 1 3 weeks passed between each step. the recruiter talked me through the process and kept me informed about the progress of my application  but the process itself is rather opaque  you do not get to know exactly what you could be working on  you re unlikely to meet people you will be working with  and you do not get much feedback until the offer   no offer. hiring decisions are made by committee s   i.e. not by a hiring manager who has an opening in his team   and although the recruiters may have a good feeling of which direction the application is going  they cannot promise anything until the decision is made. the phone interview was with one software engineer for 45 60 mins. after a few ice breaking questions  they jumped into a few technical questions and then gave me a few minutes for my questions. the on site interview consisted of 5 1 1 technical interviews of 45 minutes each with software engineers  plus a lunch break in one of the cafeterias with another engineer  in total i probably answered 20 30 different questions on data structures  algorithms  and discrete maths. you write down the answers on a whiteboard or notebook and the interviewers take notes. sometimes correct syntax is required  sometimes pseudocode is acceptable. the level of the questions varied a lot and covered a lot of areas  one minute i am manipulating the bits of a byte to implement one coding trick  the next i am discussing heuristics for an intractable problem. most interviewers gave me a few minutes at the end to ask them questions  and the discussions touched briefly on my past experience although i was not expected  and one really shouldn t  give too much information on my current work  keep in mind that the interviewee signs an nda but the interviewers don t. in my current job i do a fair amount of interviewing and i often interview candidates who give the impression of being competent but fall short of doing well in the technical interview because they re unprepared. this often leads to a no hire decision  probably an unfortunate false negative  but hiring decisions are very hard to make since bad recruits are a severe liability to an engineering team. i did not want to be such a candidate so i prepared as best as i could  luckily the process was slow enough to give me some time to do that. i read  and worked through the exercises of  textbooks on algorithms  datastructures  discrete maths  the languages i use  practiced my handwriting  brushed up on standard cs topics i do not currently use  and learned a bit about google specific technology like mapreduce. i also brushed up on my past research experience and areas related to that. i was not asked on most of what i prepared on  and i was asked on areas i did not think of preparing on  but i think that this preparation really helped me to be in the right mindset to solve the type of questions i was asked. in my opinion  good knowledge in the fundamentals is essential but the most important skill is problem solving. i was asked questions about areas i m not familiar with  but  with some help from the interviewers  i was able to break them down into smaller components i could at least tackle. i probably didn t impress in those questions but it was better than throwing in the towel. i was not asked directly on specific datastructures and algorithms  but if i decided to use some to solve a problem  then i was asked detailed questions about them. so  problem solving is the skill  cs knowledge provides the tools. i have negligible experience of being an interviewee  and it s amazing all the silly mistakes my nerves made me do  i really felt that i had misrepresented myself as being clumsy  at least more than i am...   but luckily it is a myth that one mistake is enough to fail the whole process. i did not feel the arrogance in the interviewers mentioned in other reviews here. not all of them made me feel comfortable  but overall they re what you expect from a silicon valley company. before the application proceeded  i couldn t tell how i did  but i felt that it was a fair process  and definitely a positive experience that left me with a very good impression of google  if you are good at the fundamentals  be able to show a level of expertise on everything you list in your resume  have spent the time to prepare  and you re not intimidated by relentless questioning  possibly on areas you re not that familiar with  then you have a good chance of satisfying enough interviewers to move on to the next step. keep in mind that google affords to be picky so their hiring process tries to minimize hiring bad recruits at the cost of rejecting potentially good ones.,i got the impression that interviewers are selected depending on what s on your resume. i was asked about heuristics on a specific intractable problem probably because my background included something related. you really need to know your stuff.   answer question
2010-05-11 20:55:58.087,i was contacted by a google recruiter by phone. my resume was on file from a previous interview 3 years ago which did not result in an offer. we had a short conversation about what was available at google and about what my experience was. the questions and information were very high level and it didn t seem like this was even a phone screen of any sort. she then passed me on to the hr person at the ny office. i was told that there would be a phone interview where i would need to be at a computer and would need to be able to code  but since i has already been onsite previously they decided to skip this. i was handed on to yet another person to actually schedule the interview and then back to the hr person. the onsite interview was from 10 to 3 and consisted of 5 interviews and a lunch conversation. each interview was 45 minutes and they ran pretty much right on schedule. they were difficult  but pretty much what was expected. there almost no discussion of work history or anything other than technical questions. most of the time was spent at the whiteboard working on and then refining the answer to a question. they mainly focused on data structures and algorithms around them. things like bst  hash tables  tree traversals. the questions were not standard algorithm questions that you tend to see around  but a bit more involved. they were interested in your speaking about the algorithmic complexity of your solution and how to choose appropriate data structures. hash vs. bst came up a bit. the coding that had to be done was a bit awkward for a whiteboard. the solutions were not necessarily short. one interview revolved around a higher level system design question that was refined throughout the discussion. there was very little to no time to ask questions or discuss working at google and the inteviewers did not seem interested in selling me on google. the lunch conversation was not an interview and did not contribute towards the assessment. the person i ate with was very nice and seemed honest about the way things are at google. over 2 weeks after the interview i was contacted with the rejection. overall the process was smooth and people were helpful and nice. though i did not find anyone to be particularly interested in selling the company. the interviewers were hard but fair for the most part. one interviewer did not describe the problem particularly well and had me coding a solution to the wrong problem for a while.,general algorithm questions. particularly focused on algorithmic complexity. know average and worst case time for operations on hash tables  trees  etc. the questions are not puzzles and if you know your data structures  algorithms  etc  they aren t too hard.   answer question

2010-05-15 12:11:13.087,the interesting parts of the google interview process are all under nda and you can t discuss them for two years after the interview. here s what i can tell you    their initial contact with me was via email  through linkedin. i didn t contact them.   two rounds of telephone interviews are required for out of state candidates  i.e. anybody they will have to pay to fly in . both interviews will have a  take home assignment  portion   a piece of code that you ll have to write and email to your interviewer within a fixed time  1 hour for me . if you pass these hurdles you ll be brought out to mountain view for an all day in person interview.   travel arrangements are absolutely painless  it s all handled for you and all you need to do is write an email and pick dates.   google flies you in on day x  interview day x 1  fly out day x 2  no redeyes necessary. they pay for flight  hotel  rental car  and per diem for meals. you get to pick airlines and rental companies for frequent flyer miles. note that you have to put your meals and the rental car on your own credit card  and file for reimbursement. they say to allow several weeks for reimbursement  but my experience was that the money arrived by direct deposit in about a week after filing. if you wish to stay extra days to explore the neighborhood and pay for the additional rental car and hotel expenses yourself  that s fine. the interviews are extremely technical and involve real programming exercises  manipulating data structures  analyzing or describing algorithms  etc. be prepared to iterate what you re doing on the board. be ultra prepared with knowledge of standard search and sort algorithms and junior level cs data structures  also be aware of their big o complexity. while the interview questions aren t exactly complicated  they cover so much territory that there is no way to study for them from  cold . if you are not programming on a daily basis in the languages in which you re being interviewed  you will not pass these tests. the process moves extremely quickly   at most a day or two between steps. depending on how your scheduling works  you could go from first contact to an offer in less than two weeks. absolutely everything you have read about google perks and benefits is entirely true. it s hard to imagine a company with better employee benefits.,interview questions are protected by non disclosure agreement.   2 answers

2010-05-18 00:40:56.47,of all the interviews i ve ever had  this one was the most disappointing. my experience is in nlp  and i specifically applied to google for a job doing nlp  either in machine translation  speech recognition  or one of the other many nlp tasks they do. my google interviews were the first ones i had out of college  and i was still naive enough to believe i d be asked about the stuff i ve done and that i m applying to do. wrong. hr apparently just switched my application to a generic new grad job  so the only questions i was asked were generic sorting algorithms and stuff like that. not a word about machine learning or nlp. just sorting algorithm basics that i haven t seen since sophomore year and have never and probably will never need to touch in the work place. i ve since learned from later interviews and from friends who interviewed at other places  if you re interviewing for anything in software development  there s about a 95  chance you ll only be asked generic technical questions that have nothing to do with the position you re applying for  or the things you ll be working on. it s really sad that even at a top company like google  this is still the case. i guess you just have to play the system.,define an algorithm that converts a string to an integer without using a built in method like int     2 answers given a list  return the first pair of duplicates in the list.   1 answer

2010-03-01 23:16:46.137,applied for a software engineer position. i was contacted by a recruiter for some general questions and background information. i was then instructed that i d be receiving a call the following week from another software engineer for a technical screening. the engineer called me and went over a few technical questions regarding mainly javascript and running time  big o . i was then asked to provide 2 algorithms in code within an hour after the call. overall the interview seemed to go well....as so i thought. i wasn t contacted until the following week of the results. i was turned down but they cannot give you any information of why you didn t meet their standards. they won t tell you if your code is wrong  where you went wrong or where you could improve as a developer. just a standard  your skills don t meet our needs at this time  response. kind of disappointing given that you prepare for hours upon hours of your time and energy and receive 0 feedback. how can you prepare  well  i went over all of my old cs 101 notes  hash tables  data structures  and all the theory behind it. it can be a bit overwhelming if you haven t visited that information for over a decade. my advice is to brush up on your theory and write some practical examples along those lines  like sorting an array using merge sort in your favorite language. don t worry about trying to get better in your languages...you either know it now or don t know it. it s nearly impossible to prepare for everything for this position given that they don t hire a javascript developer or c   developer. they just hire developers in general and only the top 1  developers in the world  as they indicated. don t bother asking about the position because you could be working on any number of projects and they will not give you any specifics. overall  i rate the experience a 2.5 out of 5. the interview questions i got weren t terribly difficult  but i don t know where i went wrong or how i could improve since no feedback is given. that s where google s policy needs to be revamped. the people i talked to were nice but don t expect any personality. it s very dry and straightforward and i m not really sure if that s indicative of how people are there. the youtube video on working at google seems like it s such a great place to work  but can t really say for sure at this time given my experience thus far with how they approach engineers.,give 2 coding solutions on returning an array by removing duplicates. one solution with o n 2  and the other linear.   4 answers

2015-05-21 12:29:22.243,process took 1  month from the initial talk with recruiter. routine phone interview with a couple of interesting coding questions  nothing out of the ordinary. asked to discuss runtime  improve the code  etc. onsite interview was significantly harder  for some of the questions you might not even expected to write full code in the allotted 45 minutes.,questions involving graph theory and dp   answer question
2015-02-11 01:28:04.773,the process went on for about 50 days or so. after the initial call from the recruiter  i got around 15 days to prepare for the first round  aka the screening. this was conducted over a phone call and lasted for a little more than an hour. basic questions  nothing too hard  the key was to demonstrate the thought behind the solution and find if multiple solutions exist and not just the end result. 4 days later  i got a call from the recruiter who informed me that i have been shortlisted for an onsite interview at the google office. i got around 20 days this time around to prepare. had 4 rounds of interviews at the office  mostly on data structures and their usage. the key thing again was to demonstrate your ability to arrive at a solution  rather than directly solve it. i do not think the questions were very difficult  but in some sense my nervousness got the better of me and even though i had solved a lot of similar questions during my preparation  i jumped to conclusions on the answer and delivered incomplete answers. overall  my experience with the entire hiring process right from the time of the first call till the end was very good. i am happy that i got the opportunity to review algorithms and solve many problems during the preparations. it is sad that i did not get through  but i look forward to applying again to google. as for the interactions with the employees at google  they were very helpful during the interviews or otherwise.,the question was very similar to questions from chapter about arrays from cracking the coding interview book. i cant tell exact question  but the overall idea  given integer array  count number of element pairs  satisfying some conditions. this is very popular question  so there are many examples with different conditions.   answer question

2015-07-24 01:40:43.98,i applied to google and facebook at roughly the same time. although i did not get any offer  interview at facebook was professional and friendly  and at the end i learned about my strong and weak sides. interview at google was the opposite of that. 1. recruiter sent me an email asking when we could talk. i answered specifying when i have time for a phone call. then there was over a week of silence  and finally recruiter called me on different hour that i specified. he said that he has one possible date for phone interview  so i accepted. 2. my first phone interview did not happen  because interviewer did not show up. interview was rescheduled. 3. second interview went smoothly. i answered all the questions  and interviewer seemed satisfied with the answers. 4. the same day recruiter called me and said that my evaluation was inconclusive and we need another phone interview. i asked for technical feedback  but i was not given any. the only information that i received was that  my solution was not good enough . 5. second interview went similar to the first one. again i answered all the questions. this time interviewer even said that he is satisfied with my answers. 6. after a week recruiter called me and said that evaluation was inconclusive again  and this ends recruitment process. i asked for technical feedback  and he said that he does not have any  but he will contact me when he get one. 7. after two weeks without information  i tried to contact my recruiter by email. then again by phone. 8. after a month i received anonymous survey about my interview experience. i used it to complain about lack of information from recruiter and the fact that i still do not know why i was rejected. 9. the next morning i got a call from my recruiter. he apologized for not contacting me earlier and gave me technical feedback from my two interviews. i learned that first call i failed because my solution was not optimal  it was o n log n  when o n  was possible . on the second call i implemented optimal algorithm  but there were several issues with implementation that led to lowering my evaluation to  neutral . and two neutral opinions are not enough to qualify. overall  recruiter never answered any of my emails  and each time we talk he was condescending and unfriendly. overall it was frustrating and disheartening experience.,die fragen testen zum gro en teil ob man sich mit algorithmen und datenstrukturen auskennt und schafft sie auf neue cument or a whiteboard  and then 5 minutes to ask the interviewer questions about the company  etc. i didn t get an offer but the experience was good  the recruiter kept me informed at all times and was very friendly.,can t disclose  but they were usual algorithms  data structures and system design questions. difficulty varied from one interviewer to another  but not very tough questions overall.   answer question

2015-07-16 07:48:24.093,the process for setting up the time date and preparation for the interview was smooth. the recruiter was quick on emails and polite. after a brief chat over the phone with the recruiter i had a phone interview with the technical guy  an employee . the technical guy had a heavy australian accent on top of speaking to me over a loudspeaker. i am used to american accent and understanding his speech required extra efforts of mine in addition to not hearing him properly because of his loudspeaker. i d have asked him to switch to a  normal  microphone mode but being already very stressed i didn t think about that during the interview. i applied for a fresh grad position and this interview was one of the first interviews i had in my life. the guy asked me to write down an algorithm for a problem. but before that he spent about 20 minutes of basically bragging about himself. i know that it s normal for an interviewer to introduce himself and his projects but his talk was more than that  he gave a basic description of the problem and the trick was to ask more questions in order to come up with the properly working algorithm. the guy didn t make any efforts for giving me clues or trying to lead me through the solution. he was just like  huh  ok  then what  or  huh  ok . i felt he was waiting for the interview to be over asap. i d have solved that problem but i was very nervous in part for being interviewed by google  in part for not understanding properly what he was saying  and in part for his arrogance. i immediately sensed his arrogance after he asked me this question   have you worked with large systems   to which i replied  yes  the number of nodes ranged from x to y   which was already the max number for computing in my domain   and then he  with sensible ridicule in his intonation  said something like  huh  this is not a big number.  everyone knows that google has way way bigger numbers in their systems  but that doesn t mean that the interviewer has a right to belittle the experience of the candidates  nor to expect from a fresh grad to have worked on the google scale like systems. i can t disclose the technical question asked during the interview  because you already know why.,how big was the systems i worked with    11 answers

2015-01-08 23:22:36.233,i was contacted by a recruiter for the position. google s internship application process typically works as follows  two back to back technical interviews  hiring committee  if you pass the technical interviews   and then host matching. technical interviews  in the first interview  i was asked questions regarding my resume and background. then  my interviewer gave me the opportunity to ask any questions i had. once this was done  we proceeded onto the technical portion of the interview. in the second interview  we began with the coding question. i was then given conceptual questions related to the material in courses i had already taken. in the remaining time  i was allowed to ask the interviewer any questions i had. both interviewers were courteous and friendly. hiring committee  two and a half weeks after my interviews  i heard back from my recruiter saying i had passed. my application was then sent to the hiring committee. i had no control over what happened here. the committee reviewed my interviewers  feedback and my resume  among other documents  to determine whether or not i was a promising candidate. fortunately  i was. host matching  after getting the ok from the hiring committee  my application was thrown into the host matching pool with all the other candidates who had passed the committee. in about two weeks  my recruiter notified me that a host was interested in speaking with me. my conversation with my host was rather brief and non technical. i was told some details regarding the project  which i found to be interesting. i accepted the offer.,first two questions were unexpected. i was nervous.   answer question
2015-01-15 07:28:30.33,i was told that the process would consist of 2 3 technical phone interviews  but i only had one phone interview that lasted 45 minutes scheduled. was asked questions about string manipulation and data structures. had to write code on google documents for the string manipulation question.,what do you prefer algorithms or coding    answer question
2015-01-21 11:33:16.503,i was referenced by a friend  right after that the recruiter contacted me  asked some general questions and assigned a phone interview date. on the phone interview i was given some really easy algorithmic questions. i had no trouble answering them. later on the same day the recruiter contacted me again  said that i passed the phone interview and invited me for an on sight interview to z rich. google provided me with flights and accommodation. on the on sight i had five intervie so if you get asked those questions to waste time after you probably didn t do well. that being said  i know i didn t perform as i should have  so my rejection wasn t unexpected   ,write a method that takes in a word and a timestamp  output the word if it hasn t already been output in the last 10 seconds   1 answer
2015-07-12 15:51:07.057,was asked by one of google s sourcerers  about potential interest. checked which kind of position could be. not much was said  other that we have a lot of flexibility in choosing what we want to do  location  and even title   what i was told was that everyone started as software engineering  no matter how long the career was  whether or not we came from research etc. found this a bit strange  and not being too limited in terms of time  accepted to go over the first interview. first interview was done by an engineer  former  strong  background in research. questions had nothing to do with my background though and so i asked to stop the process. again spoke with the recruiter  and she tried a second person. second interview was even worse. somebody in se  possibly experienced  who simply asked me to code a search algorithm on the fly. made no sense to me as i am not in software engineering. there seems to be a strong disparity in terms of interviews  and background...i cannot believe that the questions are the same  and that it simply goes to coding  even if one does not intend to apply for software engineering.,write down  a google doc is open  a search algorithm assuming a scenario where cars are passing and we want to check the licenses not necessarily following the order of the chars on the plate.  was not asked this clearly .   1 answer

2015-04-10 00:34:11.073,the process started by sending a resum  and a cover letter for a posted software engineer developer. after around two weeks  i got an email from a recruiter to setup a first interview on hangouts. this was more about information regarding the upcoming process of tests over the phone and the onsite ones. we decided on a time for the first phone coding test using a shared google doc to show the progress of solving two coding tasks.,the questions were really simple and easy. i would say  anyone one with a few months of coding experience would solve them.   1 answer

2015-04-26 04:20:40.99,i had been an intern  so i just had to do one system design and one algorithms design interview. from everything i d been told  i had the required experience. i was then rejected because i supposedly didn t have enough experience working with large codebases. this was despite the fact that i was told during my internship that i had done a good job of that aspect. i was never told i needed that experience before hand  infact  i was told the opposite    so it was rather frustrating. it was also silly that they interviewed me at all  given that my cv already eliminated me. it also took a long time to get the rejection  and it was in the form of a lengthy phone call from a manager explaining all about how i need more experience working with large codebases. it was very odd. i was told i could reapply in a year or 2.,i had to do lots of calculations to estimate memory usage  speeds for a large distributed system  can t give anymore details due to google s interview questions being considered intellectual property that is confidential    5 answers

2015-08-15 02:46:17.343,i have participated in the foobar contest  resulting in a message from a google hr manager. according to him  the foobar was just for the initial connection and did not affect the overall hiring process. the hr manager described the hiring process in details and sent me a set of educational resource for preparation to the interview s . when i ve studied the resources  which are mostly coding methods and explanations of behavioral questions  we settled the hangouts interview time. the hangouts interview was relatively easy  though i misunderstood the desired deliverable. it seems that the reviewer expected me to come up with a fast written solution rather than a though through verified solution. this was weird for me  though i admittedly never asked if the reviewer wanted the code fast written or well thought through. this resulted in a reject. overall  the interview process was pleasant  no serious time delays were artificially imposed  the answer came quickly. interestingly  the hr manager was speaking russian  so we discussed everything in my native language.,write a function in java to multiply two large integers  given as strings  no biginteger .   1 answer

2015-01-29 03:29:33.787,contacted by a recruiter after a former co worker from another company that is now in google recommended me. first screening interview was on site since i live close to google s offices in tel aviv. small algorithm data structure question with coding in c   and a bit of stl. the interviewer was not very nice  snobish and condescending  yet i passed without any issues and was invited to a full on site interviews day at a later date. the on site interviews included 3 interviews focusing on algorithm data structures including a bit of coding. nothing very difficult  but requiring good knowledge of topics like trees lists traversal  dynamic programming  binary search  etc. one interview was on c   knowledge  basic stuff like virtual functions  multiple inheritance  etc. with a small algorithm and coding question. last interview was a design interview   design an image sharing system in which users can upload images  then get a short url unique for their image and use it in forum messages  social networks posts  emails  etc. i was told by the recruiter that the feedback was mixed but with enough support for passing to the hiring committee. then i was rejected and told by recruiter that the design interview is the cause. i find this decision very wrong  considering what i accomplished in my career and am sure 100  that any former colleague of mine would testify very positively on my design skills  but think back on the design interview i m not surprised  the interviewer gave me a pen and papers so i could draw and write my design  but as soon as he finished asking the question he picked a pen and paper and started solving it himself  he seemed to be in a hurry to reach exactly the solution that he expects. he was not nice  arrogant and unpleasant to talk to and have an open discussion. in total 3 of the 6 interviewers were not people i would like to work with  while the other 3 were very nice and were fun to talk to and think together. i wasn t asked even once on my work experience or any of my past projects  no single  behavior  question like  describe a scenario in which you had a conflict   etc. and wasn t asked why i would like to join google or what i m looking for in a work place. it seems the entire process revolves around solving technical questions and nothing beyond that  so it s not surprising to me that 3 of 6 interviewers  in my opinion of course  had such bad people skills. i constantly had the feeling that the interviewers  all of them  prefer meek and inexperienced candidates  that can be shaped and trained to think exactly like them and would not show independent or out of the box thinking.     it actually felt to me like my experience and knowledge is an obstacle or a disadvantage instead of an asset that the company would and should appreciate         other than that   i enjoyed solving the questions  food was great  and the engineer that escorted me was very nice and friendly  we had interesting discussions   the offices look and feel great. the recruiter was super friendly  always kept me informed and did his best to speed up the process  i have only good words to say about him. i later passed successfully interviews in other companies  including google s competitors   some of which were more difficult  and received excellent offers from great work places  and i definitely think the process in google leads to bad decisions. i was offered by the recruiter to try again in 12 months  but i have no such intention  nor would i recommend it to talented people that i know.,i wouldn t describe any question as  difficult   but they definitely require you to be practiced on data structures and basic algorithms. the design question requires different skills   breaking down a very  open  question  clearly defining components in a system  interfaces between them  flow  etc.   answer question

2014-12-05 05:18:46.363,got referred by an employee  heard from a recruiter after only a few days. first a phone call to get the recruiter to know you and you to know the hiring process. then 1 3 phone interviews depending on how well you do. if you make it  you will be invited to on site interviews  which are typically 4 5 interviews on one day with different interviewers which are google software engineers with more than 3 years of experience. you will have lunch with another google software engineer  too  which will give you the opportunity to ask all kinds of questions. the interviewers usually do not ask much about you or your past work experience  90  of the interview time gets spend with coding and logical thinking questions. most coding tasks are in principle pretty simple but i gets hard to do them under the time pressure. the interviewers are told not give much feedback and some of them follow this rule to an uncomfortable extent. you will definitely need to code something within the interviews  but you can find about 75  of the coding challenges by clicking through the first ten pages of google interview reports. hints    think out loud.   try to find out how much feedback the interviewer is willing to give by asking clarifying questions.   prepare by doing some coding beforehand.   start with a simple solution but mention that there might be better ones and think about them later.,signed nda. lots of standard algorithmic questions including the usage of different data structures.   answer question

2014-10-11 01:44:25.563,i first was contacted by a google recruiter on linkedin. during the initial online meeting i was brought up to speed on how the recruiting process works at google. i decided to take on the challenge and the recruiter arranged the initial technical screening  which was conducted online as well. the intial technical screening seemed fair to me  starting with a moderate problem that can be solved in many ways  ensued by a more intricate problem where a couple of hints helped me to get it right. after a few days i got the positive answer from the recruiter and i was invited to the google zurich office for the on site interview  which took place about a month later at my request. the on site interview was tough  don t expect any less. each of the 5 sessions started with a moderate question that can be solved with adequate training  e.g. leetcode . and each of the sessions will become more difficult after solving the initial problem   the interviewer wants to see you reach your limits. expect to be mentally drained when leaving the google office. after two weeks of waiting i got feedback from the recruiter and was informed that i did not qualify for the job after all. my impression is that google is looking for people who excel in specific areas  not allrounders. and don t expect them to be impressed by any soft language skills you might bring along.,one of the sessions was about system design. the question was extremely vague but the questions i was asked were very specific. i guess the biggest part of the solution was to infer what exactly the interviewer was getting at.   answer question

2015-01-19 14:19:33.107,i was contacted by a recruiter via linkedin. we scheduled a phone interview 2 weeks later. the indian engineer who interviewed me was kind. he started by asking me a recent project that i found particularly interesting. then we moved to the actual interview and the questions where difficult for me.,given a set of rules of the form  if a a  then b must be in  b1  b2  .. bn   c in  c1  c2  .. cn   d in...  and an input a a  b b  c c.... define a data structure to store this rules and a validator to tell whether the input is valid or not. second question  now find an algorithm that  when the input is not valid according to the rules  changing one single input make the all sequence valid  if possible    answer question
2014-12-22 07:54:44.2,contacted by an excellent google recruiter. took some time to prepare for telephone interviews and  despite getting a bit flustered  i hate telephone interviews   i got enough leeway from the first to get a second. this led to a face to face interview  which i delayed until after a planned vacation. the f2f was an excellent day on site  if somewhat intense. it was very difficult to judge if you were going down the lines the interviewers wanted you to. much of the advice online is to start working through solutions to the problems they set  starting with a simple idea and improving it as you go. however with a little hindsight i can see that this actually trapped me into a significantly poorer design during the architectural interview than i thought up on the train home  despite not getting an offer  the recruiter had excellent feedback for me and explained that the hiring board had considered offering me other roles that would have played to my non technical strengths.,i would not like to share specific information about the questions since i signed a nda.   answer question

2014-08-26 03:14:44.91,i contacted google through their website and applied for a software engineer in the tel aviv office. there was an initial phone call with an hr recruiter  i think a day after i submitted my online application    just general questions about who i am and what i am looking for. after around 1 week i came to the on site screening interview   45 minutes of relatively simple graph questions   dfs bfs stuff  and maybe a bit more complex questions regarding binary trees  but nothing too special. the interviewer told me i did well  but that i should be a bit more careful about the aesthetics of the code. 2 weeks later i came to my whole day interview session   there were 6 interviews   i would say 3 which were more algorithmic  1 which was almost pure coding  and 2 which were  design . the design interviews i remember   1  design an online battlefield game   what would be the protocols between the server and the client  the algorithms and game flow to decide the state of the game  some basic networking  which i struggled with . 2  how would you design google images  the premise was that i should be able to search regarding specific features  for example the blue content  or images that are in pages that contain specific keywords. this was a very open ended question  we thought  together  about solutions  what will be the size of my data which maps words to images  where would i store the images  how many servers i would need  etc... i had no previous experience in large scale design   the interviewer said that it wasn t expected of me. i thought i did relatively well  but i guess they are looking for people with previous experience in large scale design  from the input i got later on. algorithmic interviews i remember   1  how would you design an efficient algorithm to find out in a sorted array which number appears the most times. i started from the simple solution  and continued to a more complex one   with some hints along the way from the interviewer  that in summary does a binary search of the number of times the most frequent number appear    think about it   i have an array of size n  if the most frequent number appears n 2 times  then i can infer this just from sampling the values at indexes  0 n 4 n 2 n 3 4 n . i thought i did well in that interview. 2  write code that prints the cartesian product  row by row for each combination  of a given list of lists  that contain integers . since you don t know from beforehand how many lists there are  you obviously can t just hard code lots of for loops. during the interview i gave two solutions   a recursive one  and after writing it out  they asked me to also write a non recursive one   which i did with a counter which maps each times to a different combination of values  with some mod mathematics . i think i also did well in that interview. there was a lunch break where it was obvious they simply told someone that today  you have to eat lunch with a candidate . it was a bit awkward at first  but it did give me a chance to interrogate him about how it is to work in google. the food was extra yummy. after one week i got a response that i didn t pass the interview process. the guy stressed that i was  close   that i did really good on 2 interviews and a bit less good on the other 4. oh well. my preparation to the interview consisted of doing all the regular algorithmic coding questions   i think that did prepare me well to the relevant interviews. but there was no real preparation to the more general  system design  interviews   i think it s a bit more difficult to prepare for those  but i guess i still would have invested in that more time  retrospectively. otherwise   i thought i did pretty well in the interview day   i guess that they can be really picky about taking people who really did perfect in each and every interview. just for reference i had an interview day at facebook a few days later   i thought i did much better at the google interview day  but ended getting an offer from facebook and not google. i guess also some luck doesn t hurt. the responsive of the hiring recruiter was always prompt. he was very nice  though at times it was a bit ridiculous   telling me again and again to call him if i have any problems  even if it s during the weekend or late at night. i mean it was nice to have a sponsor that  cares for me  during the process  but there s no need to push it...,why do you want to work here   answer question

2013-02-27 01:23:38.163,i applied through a friend at google. the staffs at google are quite efficient. only two days after i submitted the resume  a recruiter contacted me and arrange a phone screen interview. three days after the phone screen  i was told that i passed the interview. an on site interview was arranged within two weeks. there are four 45 minute on site interviews  three in the morning  and one in the afternoon. the interview questions are not very hard. but some of the questions might not be selected carefully  and contain some errors. so make sure to discuss with the interviewers if you find something wrong.,due to nda  i m not supposed to talk about the interview questions. however  there have some data structure questions  such as  write a program to verify where a given binary tree is a binary search tree  and also some design questions  such as  how to improve the current http protocol  answer  spdy .   answer question
2013-03-21 05:51:44.89,after an interview workshop run by google at my university i was contacted a few weeks later by a google recruiter. i initially had a 45 minutes phone interview with an engineer answering questions and writing code on a shared google doc. after that i was invited for on site interviews. in total there were 5 interviews of 45 minutes each on that day. 4 of the interviews were mainly about problem solving and coding. the other one was more about system design  no coding  it was just a discussion . all interviews were with engineers. after the on site interviews they asked for references from supervisors managers etc.,i found the system design interview hardest. it s difficult to prepare for and hard to estimate how well you re doing. the only advice i can give is to stay relaxed and talk about the ideas that come to your mind. the interviewer was quite helpful and it was more like brainstorming.   answer question
2013-03-18 10:29:09.94,i was contacted by a recruiting contact from hr. from there i was passed off to another contact who scheduled two back to back  45 minute coding interviews. the first interviewer was very pleasant. after initially asking a question on which i fumbled  we spent the remaining time working on one question. the question itself wasn t terribly difficult  but it was intentionally ambiguous  to make sure i asked the right questions. after clearing up details we discussed optimizations  etc. this is probably the part of the interview that was most enjoyable as it didn t really feel like i was getting grilled. it felt as if we were discussing a problem and different approaches we could take. the second interviewer had a bit of an accent and seemed a bit less engaged helpful. also  the questions he asked were significantly tougher. all in all the process went very smoothly.,i was asked to write an algorithm to solve a crossword like puzzle  i forget the name  but started with a  b  . as opposed to simply vertical  horizontal  and diagonal placement of words  they were allowed to snake around the grid in any way. i immediately thought  recursion  since you have to check every adjacent grid space to make a possible word. needless to say  i didn t completely finish coding  but i did have the thought process correct.   answer question

2012-11-14 19:24:43.497,the hiring process usually begins with one or two phone screens  followed by a day of onsite interviews. i applied through my university  so the initial phone screens were replaced by two more back to back in person interviews. if all goes well during the onsite interviews  there is a series of three hiring meetings behind closed doors  each higher level than the last  after which an offer is made.,i do take my nda seriously  but in general terms  the interview questions at google are extremely difficult and often very tricky. with that said  contrary to popular opinion  they are not necessarily any harder than the questions that any tech company with high standards would ask. know your data structures and algorithms back to front  be prepared for questions as high level as very general oop design problems and as low level as bit manipulations  and know your resume cold  because every interviewer was interested in at least one item on it. i highly recommend finding a copy of at least one coding interview book  cracking the coding interview  programming interviews exposed  and design   analysis of algorithms served me well  and tackling the problems in it    they will give you a good idea of what to expect. i will say that i had never seen any of the questions i was asked in my google interviews  whereas the rest of the industry seems to recycle the same 20 questions over and over   but my practice with general interview style coding questions was extremely useful nonetheless. remember that the interviewer wants to see how you approach a problem you haven t necessarily seen before  so think out loud a lot  and don t forget your edge cases    answer question

2012-06-23 11:15:00.277,the process  recruiter contacted me via linkedin  had some phone email conversations  then talked to someone at google to decide to apply or not. had a phone interview then on site. the on site was 5 separate interviews plus lunch. the process is pretty long  though the turnaround between phone interview and on site was quicker than other steps. one of the flaws of the process is that they don t have things together... the phone interviewer didn t know if i d been notified about the phone interview  he hadn t when he interviewed  and so we didn t use google docs for coding   just more general questions. something like 3 of my on site interviewers were replaced last minute  room confusion  lateness  etc. follow up with recruiter tended to be a day after it was supposed to be. the coding questions are much like you ve seen on this site and others. there was a focus on tough general algorithms questions. i understand that they like to use variations on actual problems they ve encountered  but they seemed to be  mostly  artifacts from such a heavy focus on distributed computing. i don t get to do distributed computing in my normal duties  so i was unprepared. the other downside is that there seemed to be too much focus on computational complexity and not as much on readability  maintainability  development time constraints. the hardest part is that placement doesn t happen until the time of the offer. so you don t know if you ll actually want to go until you re really invested in it. my advice for interviewers  work on hard graduate level algorithms problems to prepare  slight focus to the weird sorts of things you have to do for distributed programming. if the interviewer is asking you a design question  make sure they clarify what they re actually for. my advice for google  try to mesh the questions with the candidate s background better. give more clear in interview feedback about whether the solution is adequate  how it could be better. allow for more time for the candidate to ask questions. there s no downtime at all for almost 6 hours  so maybe an easy question after lunch  give more detailed feedback about specific weaknesses. spend some time convincing the candidate that this is a good fit for their experience  or not    without a job description you don t even know if it s interesting or not. all this sounds very negative but you can really feel the excitement on google campus.,they ask you not to reveal questions  so i won t.   1 answer

2012-05-08 06:51:06.147,i applied to a job at google using their website. the position was software engineer in mountain view. after posting my cv i received an email in which i was invited to an interview. the first interview was with an hr person  simple talk  short  nothing special. i was programmed for another phone interview a week after the first one. this time it was a technical one. i was given a google doc link and i had to use that document to write the algorithm for a problem that my interviewer presented to me. the problem was significantly less complex than i expected  similar to the ones that we used to do in high school when studying algorithms. unfortunately i did not performed well. the interview was scheduled at evening  in my timezone i am not from the us  and after an chaotic day at work i could not concentrate as i should. one advice that i would give is to focus on the problem  not on the person talking to you. i did this huge mistake  i was more preoccupied on explaining him what i wanted to do that i could not focus on getting the problem done. i kept explaining to him my every thought so i ran out of time. i am not saying to think and write the code without any explanation since you may get a hint or two from the one holding the interview. at first i started on the wrong path since i was so eager to get to the solution. please stop  think it through  analyze your solution than expose it and try to code it. maybe this may help someone. i wish i could have another chance. if i had stopped and think without jumping to code it  the outcome would have been another one. the day after my interview when i thought at that problem  i solved it in 5 minutes. it is too late for me but maybe this advice can help another person. good luck to all of you applying to a google job. ps  stay relaxed   ,the problem was not difficult  simple algorithmic skills would get you through   answer question

2010-08-02 16:21:02.54,the whole process was excessively long  almost 4 months passed between submitting a resume  and the last round of interviews. i met a total of 7 engineers and one hr person. half of these people had worked at the office for less than 1 year. two of the more experienced engineers made several comments during problem sessions which seemed unprofessional to me  or as though they had fairly poor interpersonal skills. two of the people who interviewed me seemed to be very young  these were probably the nicest people i met there  although i wondered why someone barely out of university was tasked with evaluating my skill set. despite providing a very detailed resume  and being present for two onsite interviews totaling over 7 hours  no one asked any serious questions about my background. all the interviewers focused on undergraduate level programming problems in the areas of data structures  graphs and a basic architecture question. there were no behavioral questions  i had no opportunities to explain my past work experience. the company has a very good reputation overall  although it didn t seem to be fully represented by the people that i met. i m not too disappointed about not being offered a job.,i was asked questions in the areas of data structures  graphs  and architectures.   1 answer

the one thing i did not like about the interviews   but am not at all surprised at   is that they aren t too interested in selling you on the company or helping you find out what working there would be like. none of the interviewers bothered to tell me what they did  what group they worked for or what their title was. i barely had time to ask any questions and almost felt like it wasn t important to some of them to leave room for me to ask questions. i ended up asking the recruiter all the questions after the interviews were over. the recruiter kept me informed throughout the process when my application passed from hiring committee to executive hiring committee. the total turnaround time from onsite interview to offer was less than 2 weeks   which doesn t sound as long as some of the other experiences posted. advice to anyone interviewing  know your stuff. if you don t have a solid knowledge of fundamentals   start studying. if you don t know how to analyze the running time of your algorithm   go learn. if you don t have experience coding   practice.,implement a function  f int n  to calculate the nth fibonacci number.   answer question
