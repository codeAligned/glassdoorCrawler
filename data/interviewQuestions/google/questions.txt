Sparse matrices are usually stored by only storing the non-zero values. But, there is no single standard format for doing this. One such format is called Compressed Sparse Column (CSC).

You are given an n by n array filled with '0's, and you have to set randomly X number of '1's in that array. Looping and generating x random number doesn't work as you might get the same random number (especially as X gets closer to n*n, collisions will become more likely in which case you'll loop for a very long time before filling all the '1's). All positions must have the same probability to get selected, and the array might be huge.   14 Answers

All types of systems, UNIX, filesystems type question. One question in particular was "When you type www.google.com into a browser what happens?" I gave an answer of DNS resolving, first the client will see if it has an IP address cached for Google and if not contact one or more nameservers. I then went into detail about how DNS works and the various types of records and how the whole system has a hierarchy, zone transfers etc. At the end the interviewer asks "What really happens?" &lt;sigh&gt; Many times your interviewer will have very poor English skills and you will have to constantly ask them to repeat their questions - which does not look good for you. Other questions ask about how a basic filesystem works with inodes and hard links vs soft links. For my last phone interview I was told it would be focused on computer networking and the interviewer only asked questions about filesystems - nothing about networking.   1 Answer

Signed NDA and will respect the NDA. For a new grad, they focus primarily on CS fundamentals, so know your data structures and algorithms well. However, be able to think through your code design in terms of scalability, even if they don't ask you to parallelize the code. I think they test the same concepts as Microsoft does, but I'll summarize the difference between the two companies without revealing any coding questions. Microsoft will ask you questions like, "If apples cost $2 and bananas cost $3, how much does it cost me to buy 3 apples and 2 oranges?" Google will ask you a question along the lines of, "If apples cost $2 and bananas cost $3, and I have a $1 million dollars, how many unique fruit combinations can I buy?" Simply put, Google questions are more in depth and require more thought and finesse, even though the same concepts are used in solving them.   Answer Question

The first phone interview was just a series of high level questions. Here are a couple: 1) Why are calls to virtual functions slower 2) How would you find the maximum occurrence of a word in a huge file (no coding - just high level explanation). 3) What is the factory pattern. Things like that The second phone interview was purely coding 1 big long, but easy problem. The problem was this: Write code to verify a Sudoku board.   1 Answer First Person: Simply high level questions about how to achieve certain things. For example: 1) How would you write a pancake sort routine 2) You have a network of friends (linked in friends, facebook friends, etc). How would you keep track of all the people you are connected to. 3)level questions about how to achieve certain things. For example: 1) How would you write a pancake sort routine 2) You have a network of friends (linked in friends, facebook friends, etc). How would you keep track of all the people you are connected to. 3) What is the run time of the A* search (only because I mentioned it somewhere along the line). Second person: 1) Write code to find duplicates in a linked list 2) How would you synchronize a linked list across multiple computers. If nodes are added/removed to a linked list on one computer, all others must reflect this change. Concurrancy must be accounted for   1 Answer Third person: Given a 2-d array, write code to print it out in a snake pattern. For example, if the array is this: 1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6 7, 8, 9 the routine prints this: 1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5 The array is an NxN array. The final question was just how to write a connection pool (i.e, a class that returns connections to the user, and if the user is done, returns them back to the pool)   4 Answers Given a set top box: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o p, q, r, s, t u, v, w, x, y z Write code to give the character sequence given a word, For example, if the word is "CON", the function will print this: Right//now we're at B Right//now we're at C OK//to select C Down DOwn Right Right OK//to select O Left//now at N OK//to select N note: Be careful when you're at Z. if you go to the right, you will get stuck. Afterwards, the interviewer adds a space to the right of 'Z' to test the code.   2 Answers Write a routine that does secret santa in O(N) time.   4 Answers

After I completed the coding question, we had plenty of time and I am asked a bunch of floating point numbers related questions. 1. Given an array of floats. you have a sum function that takes the float array as input, but it returns a different result every time you change the order of the float numbers in the array, why? 2. How does the floating point numbers are represented in binary? 3. How to add two floating point numbers in binary? The answers to these questions lie in the The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754) and you can find sources online. I got really frustrated with these serious of questions, because they have nothing to the with the coding interview. After struggling finding answers, I finally ran out of time. I was so relieved though that the interview was over, because it really felt like a torture in the end with the interviewer beating a dead horse.   1 Answer

The setup is that we are given a series of text files which contain information regarding a code repository's commits. Each file represents a single commit and they are formatted as follows: " Commit #: XXX Author: XXX Reviewer(s): XXX, XXX, ... File: XXX File: XXX ... Date: XX:XX:XX XX/XX/XXXX " The commit number is unique and is generated in synchronous order. There is exactly 1 unique author. There are a variable number of reviewers, delimited by commas; if there are no reviewers, that line is absent from the file. There are a variable number of edited files in the commit, each receiving its own line. The time/date is when the commit was submitted. First design a graphical model for all of the commit data. Then describe how this model is updated when a new commit is generated. Finally, write the code segment called when a new commit is generated which edits a system that has implemented your model of the data - its input is a file name and whatever necessary data structures that are maintained by your system.   Answer Question

Basically the interview went really with with the second interviewer, I talked/worked my way through a solution to the complex problem he asked (the question tested my ability to identify precise expectations, clearly define problem scope, and use the most appropriate data structures that whose inherit properties were best suited for the problem). It went less than ideal with the first interviewer because I stumbled a few times while attempting to design a solution to the graph traversal question. Once I wrote a solution that I was pretty happy with, he noticed a flaw and we walked through an example where my solution did not work. I began to explain my mistake and write the code to address it, but we ran out of time before I could design a fully working solution. Bummer.   Answer Question

Can not mention specific questions due to NDA and I don't think it would help either. The main thing, however, is to have solid fundamentals. Know your algorithms, data structures and discrete math. Before the interview, make sure you get comfortable writing code on a whiteboard or a piece of paper. We are so used to writing code on the computer that when we switch to a whiteboard, our brain does not accept the fact that any code written on the board would be useful :P. I think that if you do enough practice on the whiteboard, it would only make it easier for you in the interview. Having done all the technical preparation, the most important thing is not to be nervous during the interview and practicing on the whiteboard certainly does help in that regard.   2 Answers

One of the interviewers at google-plex asked essentially the same technical question as my initial interviewer in NC. I had done well on this, so I was faced with this awkward decision about whether to tell the second person that I had already been asked this question. So I decided to tell him - he got a little flustered and we then moved on to an elaboration which was more difficult to handle - at least in part because I could not really connect with the interviewer on what it was he was asking. Ah well. Here's the initial question: Describe and code and efficient algorithm to decide if two rectangles in a coordinate plane are overlapping or not.

Google asks interviewees to not share specific details on interview questions. They were coding-oriented questions. They required a varied set of algorithms and data structures to solve, especially including graphs, heaps, linked lists, and hash tables. Sorting algorithms were also emphasized. Some of the interview questions were quite unique, but could be abstracted in neat ways. Google does provide a significant amount of material before the interview(s) to help you study, including links to reading material and the types of questions you can expect. They were relatively difficult, but the interviewers were helpful.   1 Answer

You're given a binary tree and pointers to two nodes in the tree. Describe the fastest algorithm you can come up with to determine the closest common ancestor.   4 Answers You're writing an application that receives a stream of individual items of data. The stream may be very long or very short, but you have no way of knowing how long it is (i.e. there's no trick to figuring out the size of the stream of data). How would you go about choosing m items such that any subset of m items was equally likely? (Not an even distribution of values, but just that any m items are equally likely to be chosen). So for example, m=1000, and the number of items in the stream, n, may be 1000, or 10000, or 100000000, or much much larger; there is no way to know how many.   4 Answers

It has two publing tightBot">Interview Submitted resume online on 2009-09-15. Received an email from someone in Staffing on 2009-10-07 asking for my location preferences, whether I am eligible to work in US, and actual date of intended graduation. Received email from recruiter in Seattle/Kirkland office on 2009-10-08 to schedule a phone call. Told me we would talk about Google's recruiting process and focus on my background, education, and career interests to ensure that I speak with engineers who have a background and interests similar to my own. Received call from recruiter as scheduled on 2009-10-14. We talked about Google's recruiting process, but not so much about my background, education, and career interests. I made sure she had my latest resume and I asked some questions about work-life balance in the Seattle office and also about Google's IP/non-compete policies. After the call I emailed times I would be available for two back-to-back technical phone interviews. Received email from recruiter on 2009-10-15 confirming my scheduled time for two back-to-back technical phone interviews. Email included information about types of software engineer positions in the office and links to various Google pages (Labs, Code, lifeatgoogle Youtube channel) and Yegge's advice article. Also asked me to answer a few preliminary questions about myself to ensure I don't have any conflicts. Received call from first Google engineer as scheduled on 2009-10-20. He described his work in Gmail on contact management and chat, mainly using C++. He asked me to describe a big project I've worked on and I told him about my thesis and its accompanying software implementation. He then asked some technical questions. I asked him about his work-life balance in that office and asked him if working there is anything like what you read about in Hamming's "You and Your Research." After the interview I hung out for a couple hours waiting for the next phone call but it never came. I contacted the recruiter and she informed me that the second interviewer was unable to access his calendar and was unable to call. We rescheduled the second interview. Received phone call from second engineer as rescheduled on 2009-10-23. He told me how he works on Google Maps and used to work on Talk at the Kirkland office. He asked me to talk about my thesis and I did, but for some reason I got really nervous talking about it this time. Voice was shaky for a while. After that he asked two technical questions. I asked him about his work-life balance at that office and what his most interesting use of Google's tremendous resources has been. I was told by both engineers that I would hear from the recruiter soon so I waited for a week and a half or so. On 2009-11-04 I emailed the recruiter asking if we would be proceeding with the interview and later that evening I received a call from her stating the engineers enjoyed talking to me but we would not be moving forward. The overall process was enjoyable, even when I was an anxious wreck. The technical interviews boosted my confidence, even though I stumbled on the easiest questions (postorder & basic C programming). The first engineer was far more polite & humble than the second one, but the second one was certainly civil enough. The recruiter was kind, easy to talk to, and obviously put effort into answering all of my tough questions about the Seattle/Kirkland offices & Google policies. I learned that the Seattle/Kirkland offices tend to be a little more laid-back than the Mountain View office. Also, Google does make you sign a non-compete but it's not overly draconian. Many engineers run their own companies after hours and are even allowed to use AdWords and whatnot, provided they sign some agreements. I encourage you to go through the process for interview practice if nothing else.

You are not stopping twice in the same city. - You forgot the original departure city. - You forgot the final destination city. - All the tickets you have are randomly sorted. Question are: - Design an algorithm to reconstruct your trip with minimum complexity. - How would you improve your algorithm.

First interview - Warmup: The interviewer asked me a series of short questions. The running time (best, worst, average) of various sorting algorithms such as merge sort, quick sort and heapsort. He also asked me about hash table and hash functions (average and worst case complexity of insertion, deletion and lookup). Central Question: Consider a setup where a program is continuously receiving floats as inputs (a stream of numbers). The task is to write a method that at any given time returns a moving average. That is the average of the last k numbers received. If the method is called before the program has received k numbers, simply return the average of however many numbers have been received thus far. The solution should obviously be optimal. Second interview - Warmup: Given an array of integers, write a method that places all the zeros at the end. Main question: Consider an interface which has the following two methods: interface Counter {  void inc();  int getLastMinuteCount(); } The method inc() is supposed to help keep track of the number of requests that clients make to a server (or something else along those lines). The getLastMinuteCount() is supposed to return the number of requests that the server has received in the last minute. The question is to implement a class that has these two methods included.   Answer Question

4.The phone interview : (in Chinese mandarin) The interviewer called and first started with my past works and asked me to introduce my projects that is special. I talked about around 2 projects and he would ask some questions according to what I said. I think he cares does the project relate to internet or cloud application, but unfortunately I did not involve too much. After that he asked me two technical questions. I'm not allowed to expose the detail about the technical questions as the HR mentioned in the email. The first question is to write a code on a Google Doc that we shared. It was not too difficult. I think everyone can do it well as long as he(she) has practiced to write codes and review basic algorithms and data structures. Though I was too nervous and made some mistake and said a lot of nonsense. After I finished most part, he asked me could I further optimize it. I didn't figure out any but just during the time I guessed around he pointed out the way he thought. The second question was an open question. I told him my approach and he asked for more detail. And he pointed out the disadvantage about my approach. And after that he asked is there any other approach in my mind. I tried hard to think about another and he also discussed with me the trade off of. During the whole process, the interviewer was silent and made me thought that the phone was disconnect(my cell phone does that many times). I think maybe he was waiting for me to say more, discuss more or some better answers. Too bad I was really nervous and couldn't think too much.   Answer Question

Given an input string S write a function which returns true if it satisfies S = nT. Basically you have to find if a given string can be represented from a substring by iterating it “n” times. n &gt;= 2 An example would suffice – Function should return true if 1) S = “abab” 2) S = “abcdabcd” 3) S = “abcabcabc” 4) S = “zzxzzxzzx” Function should return false if 1) S = “abac” 2) S = “abcdabbd” 3) S = “abcabcefg” 4) S = “zzxzzyzzx” It would be easy to understand if you can give an algo instead of saying use kmp or suffix tree or… I came up with O(n*n) solution. Wondered how to do in O(n)   25 Answers

They asked two questions. 1. O(n*log n) time to find the k-th largest element of a n*n matrix, given every row or column of the matrix is pre-sorted. 2. O(log n) tome to find the k-th largest element of two pre-sorted array. Both questions were expected to be well disscussed, then to write pseudocode and test cases. I found it was very stressful and the time was not enough. I provide a O(n^2) solution for the first one, and solved the second one. But I they didn't move me forward.   2 Answers

I do take my NDA seriously, but in general terms: the interview questions at Google are extremely difficult and often very tricky. With that said, contrary to popular opinion, they are not necessarily any harder than the questions that any tech company with high standards would ask. Know your data structures and algorithms back to front; be prepared for questions as high-level as very general OOP design problems and as low-level as bit manipulations; and know your resume cold, because every interviewer was interested in at least one item on it. I HIGHLY recommend finding a copy of at least one coding interview book (Cracking the Coding Interview, Programming Interviews Exposed, and Design & Analysis of Algorithms served me well) and tackling the problems in it -- they will give you a good idea of what to expect. I will say that I had never seen any of the questions I was asked in my Google interviews (whereas the rest of the industry seems to recycle the same 20 questions over and over), but my practice with general interview-style coding questions was extremely useful nonetheless. Remember that the interviewer wants to see how you approach a problem you haven't necessarily seen before, so think out loud a lot, and don't forget your edge cases!   Answer Question
