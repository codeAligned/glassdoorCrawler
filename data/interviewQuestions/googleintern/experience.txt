I had two technical phone interviews (not too bad - I felt like luck had a factor) followed by a longer host-matching period.

Submitted resume online and got connected by recruiter. Then scheduled two 45-mins technical phone interviews with Google engineers. It was not hard but I gave them wrong answer about time complexity. But the engineers are very nice and friendly. After that I got the email about making a third phone interview. I think that might because I did just on average in the first two rounds and they want to give me another chance. But later I got several other offer deadlines approaching and thus declined further interview process with Google. Google's host matching round takes quite a time. But great company though.

I applied for this job and in a month was contacted by a recruiter. He has set two technical interviews one after another and let me choose the date. Both interviews were tech screens (in Google Hangouts), took approximately 45 minutes and had identically the same structure - first 3-4 minutes interviewer introduces himself and lets you quickly introduce yourself, then he asks you one programming question, you need to code your solution in Google doc so that he sees your performance.

I interviewed with Google in late March last year for the Software Engineer Internship for 2013. It's a technical interview. They're not that interested in your resume, but they want to know what you can do and how you think, coding-wise. The questions aren't particularly tricky, but it's a phone interview, so it can be pretty difficult to convey your coding ideas over the phone. Meanwhile, they watch you as you type on a Google doc.

Given a TV remote, write a script that would give directions to input some letters. Starting from the upper left-hand corner.

FIrst I had two technical interviews, which were back to back, by phone, 45 minutes each. I coded in a Google Doc that was shared with the interviewer. They asked standard factual questions about Java and OOP (which I had stated I was familiar with) and asked me to work through a programming problem in the language of my choice (I chose Perl, the interviewer wasn't familiar but was fine with that). I made some mistakes in my code, didn't check some boundary conditions, the interviewer asked e.g. "what about when x = y", I fixed it, it was fine. Then I had two interviews with potential hosts, they asked me what I wanted to get out of the internship, what experience I had with the technologies they used, and how I would approach various research and engineering problems.

2 phone interviews, mostly technical, only a couple of minutes for your own questions at the end and perhaps a brief introduction of your previous experience at the beginning. If the interviews go well, then host matching begins. Different potential hosts interview candidates until they find a suitable match. The host matching is usually just a relaxed conversation.

I can't remember the toughest question. Preparing with TopCoder, ACM ICPC or uva online judge should do. Try to keep the conversation going at all times. It's alright to take a pause for a couple of seconds and think, but it's important to always let the interviewer know how we are tackling the problem.   Answer Question

2 Back-to-back phone interviews using Google Doc. The first one with a Software Engineer who had Indian accent was pretty good. Two coding questions related to string manipulation and tree structure. But no questions related to resume were asked. Then, the second one was with a Software Engineer who had Chinese accent. I spent quite a long time to understand what he meant many times during the interview. He asked me about many Low level systems questions and questions about the most challenging projects I had done. Then, there was an unorganized and unclear question about dictionary. However, in 10 minutes, it turned out to be implementing/overriding a function in java String class. It was kind of weird. And then, at last, when he told me that what questions I would like to ask him, I said "Could you tell me something about your team? And how long have you been working in Google?" Pretty normal questions, right? However, then, he was like "It seems like you are doing a survey!" WT...His replies really made me feel quite uncomfortable.

I submitted my resume online on their website. A recruiter contacted me within 2 weeks. Interview times are very flexible. Gave me a whole month to pick dates from. I had two phone interviews (45 minutes each) back to back.

This was my first technical interview, so I was very unprepared. I will say prepare well. The first interview was not really hard, and the interview help you a lot through the process. Think loud while you are coding (on Google Doc), interviewer will help you, and it allows him to analyze your problem solving skills. It consisted of some String related questions, their efficiencies and way to improve your code. The second interview was meant to be hard (as the interviewer himself mentioned.

Got in touch with with Google through a campus recruiting event, talked to the recruiter and she told me to turn it in online. A month or two later I was sent an email saying that I had gotten an interview! I was so excited. I had two phone interviews, that were supposed to be 45 minutes long each with a 15 minute break between them. The first interviewer called me 15 minutes late so that was a little annoying. We didn't chit-chat or anything and got straight to the problem, which was a board game problem (I won't go further because I don't want to breach my NDA). When my interviewer asked me the question, my mind went blank and I had no idea how to solve it right away so I just talked my way through it. Overall I felt I didn't do too well on this question and I took almost whatever time I had left in the interview to solve this problem. The second interviewer called about 1-2 minutes after the first interviewer hung up and he talked about what he did a little bit and then we got down to the problem solving. Again, I don't want to breach my NDA so I can't really say what my question was. I thought I solved this problem pretty well and it sounded like my interviewer was fine with my solution. We then talked about another problem and rather than having me code it, he just asked me to describe how I would solve it. After I did this, I asked him some questions about his history and what it was like to work at Google and then we ended the interview about 5 minutes early because we were more or less done. It took Google about 3 weeks to get back to me (it was a dreaded wait) however I knew after the first interview I wasn't going to get an offer. I felt that to get an internship you needed to blow both the interviews out of the park and I felt like I barely got by the first one and blew the second one out of the park, which wasn't going to be enough. Overall, I was really nervous because this was my first interview with a big name company and I feel like that really got to me in the first interview. Even though I didn't get an offer, it was really good practice because I ended up interviewing at Microsoft and I learned what not to do in the interview (like be nervous!). I was able to remain calm during my Microsoft interview and I ended up getting an offer there, which I don't think I would have been able to do unless I had this interview with Google.

The process started when I applied for a Software Engineering Intern position online. The online application was relatively simple and included basic information such as name, address, education, work experience etc. It took approximately 2 weeks after submitting my online application before a recruiter contacted me to schedule 2 phone interviews. After several emails sent back and forth, both interviews were scheduled, one right after the other. Both interviewers were very nice and helpful during the interview. Each interview was between 40 and 50 minutes long. I had heard that sometimes the interviewers can be condescending and distant, but this was not the case in my interviews.

Submitted my resume online and was contacted within a week by my recruiter. She set up two 45 minute interviews for 3 weeks later. The interviews were back to back. I can't give details about the questions because of the NDA, but the first dealt mainly with common data structures and algorithms - any computer science major should have been able to easily code the solutions. I got through about 6 questions with a few bugs along the way (mainly because of nerves) but the interviewer was very nice about pointing them out and giving me an opportunity to correct them. The second interview did not go nearly as well. I got stumped on the first question and ended up spending all 45 minutes on it; it shouldn't have been very hard, but it dealt with a concept I hadn't thought about for a while so I didn't know where to begin. The interviewer was not particularly friendly or helpful (he would correct my code as I wrote it which was a bit annoying and nerve-wracking) but overall wasn't mean. By the end of the 45 minutes I had a working (although not at all elegant) solution. Seeing as my second interview went so terribly I was shocked when I received an email the next day from my recruiter saying I made it to the host matching phase. I was in Google purgatory for 3 and a half long weeks before I heard back from a potential host in Boulder, CO. My recruiter set up an interview for the following week. The host interview hardly felt like an interview, it was very conversational and was mostly him telling me about the position. He ended the phone call basically telling me I had the job; about 5 minutes later I received a congratulatory email from my recruiter, and was given the official offer the next day.

Contacted by HR and had 2 technical phone interviews. The first interviewer had a strong accent which has been a really big problem during the whole interview. He was trying to give tips and I made him type in google doc where I had to code. Second interviewer was great, we talked a lot about the company and he was laughing to the jokes I made. Questions were simple, don't study too much just repeat the data structures and test cases to verify the correction of your code. Recruiters send an email telling you what to go over, it has bunch of stuff written you don't need to get frustrated, because they're way too complex and you will be never asked to implement them in 45 minutes.

An employee at Google helped me submit my resume to their referral system. Two days later a recruiter contacted me and asked me to fill some standard forms about my location preference and skills. Then another recruiter asked me preferred dates for two telephone interviews. There were two 45 minute interviews and the interviewer were very well-prepared. Very standard data structure and algorithm coding problems. They helped me throughout the whole process. Make sure that you think aloud and tell them your thoughts and concerns. Do not hesitate to ask them if there's anything not clear. Although I made some mistakes and got the final correct answer/code after a lot of their hints, I was noticed one day after my interview that I had passed. Then was the host matching process. Someone(including me) may think that if apply early, we would get an offer for internship if we can pass the tech interviews because Google would match you to different hosts until summer. BUT this was not the case. Now they have a new policy. If the recruiter can't find a host that shows interest to the candidate within several weeks, the intern will be rejected. It seems a lot of candidates who pass the tech interviews can't get an offer because no match can be found. After a host showed interest to me, we had a non-technical phone talk, which was about half an hour. He first asked some experiences on my resume. Then introduced his project and asked if I was interested. We were both satisfied and two days later my recruiter told me she will prepare an offer. One more week later I got a phone call from the recruiter about the offer and two more days later I got the offer letter. It's an intern position at Mountain View. Satisfied and accepted immediately.

My recruiter was very friendly. She was a little slow to respond to emails, but it wasn't too bad. The technical interviews were fairly easy. After the technical interview, there were project interviews. These were just to determine whether or not I would be interested in a given project; it was for my benefit more than theirs. I ended up turning down their offer the first year to take an opportunity programming for public health in Cambodia, but they told me that I could go with them the following year without having to repeat the technical interview. The next year, my recruiter connected me with a project in Google.org that I accepted.

Interviewing with Google was not bad. They have a process of phone interviews, where you use Google Documents during the interview to write answers to programming questions. They ask a variety of computer science questions and are interested in seeing how you think. Overall, nothing too surprising. The corporate culture seems very good, and this is what attracted me to the company in the first place. They seem genuinely interested in finding people who are excited by the prospect of solving challenging problems. The best questions during the interviews were the ones where the interviewer presented a problem from his relevant Google project and asked for ideas on how to address it.

Given this Google product, how would you address this technical challenge? What kinds of algorithms would you use?   Answer Question

Applied online before Christmas, didn't expect to hear back at all, but in late January got an email and 2 45-minute technical interviews over the phone were scheduled. A couple of days before the first interview, I contacted the recruiter as I wasn't confident I have had enough time to prepare. My interview was pushed back a week, which was extremely nice of Google. In the first inverview, I was asked to code a very basic, well-known algorithm but the interviewer did not specify that in the question, it was more like 'how would you do this?'-type question. Then I was asked to walk through a sample input and explain how the algorithm would execute. Finally I was asked how I would adequately test the algorithm. Second question involved coming up with a solution to a problem involving 2 integer arrays. No coding was required, just an explaination of how I would go about it. Second interviewer had me explain some object-oriented concepts, even though I chose to answer in C. There were some ambigious questions about the Google search engine and the Google servers, which I'm pretty sure I did not answer correctly. Then I was asked to write an encryption function, and once I managed to complete it, the problem was made more difficult a couple of times and for each I had to rewrite the code to suit the problem. Overall, I thought the interviews were not as hard as I thought they would be, and both of the interviewers were quite nice and patient, explaining concepts I did not understand, or helping me find the right solution. At the end of each interview I had some time to just chat with them, and ask questions, which I thought was great.

I applied online and the process took 4+ weeks - interviewed at Google in March 2014. The process had two stages, interviews, followed by project assignment. The process was comfortable. All questions are framed to your personality and your CV, focus was on programming languages and algorithms. That was the trend for both. I was unsuccessful at the interview stage, I waited for a month to hear back from them after I had finished my both technical interviews. In my case the interviewers never asked any personal questions and we moved straight to coding so I found it difficult to blend in. The first interviewer was a bit unenthusiastic and intimidating which also threw me off a bit but the second interviewer I had was really nice and helpful in describing what we had to do properly.

First interview is scheduled on 10:45, and the second interview is scheduled on 11:45. The first interviewer is an American girl, she just asked me some easy algorithms questions. About 30 minutes we run out of those problems, then we just talk about some projects on my resume. The second interviewer is late for the interview.

I applied for a 12 month internship in the UK around October and got a reply in November saying that they would like to schedule 2 phone interviews (I got to select some dates that I were free). The recruiter was extremely friendly and even linked me to a lot of webpages with information about what kind of questions I can expect in the interview. A lot of which included CS theory such as OOP and data structures. I was scheduled 2 45-minute interviews. Unlike what I expected, I had to complete 2 programming tasks (one in each interview) with no questions about computer science theory. Under the stress of being in an interview, and due to the expectation of CS theory questions, my mind blanked despite having 2 tasks which I could complete with ease - of course I regret being such an idiot - So long as you focus logically on what you do the interview should be a fairly easy process, although the randomness of the code can throw you off guard. The first interviewer was a bit unenthusiastic and intimidating which also threw me off a bit but the second interviewer I had was really nice and helpful in describing what we had to do properly. Due to my idiocy I did not progress to the next stage.

I applied online at their website. The HR person called me first to explain the next steps of the process: 2 technical phone-interviews and, if successful, another one with my future potential project manager. The first 2 phone interviews were scheduled (45 min + 45min, with 15 min interval between the two), but I guess they forgot me because only the second person called me. In this interview, I was asked to code. Only to code. He almost didn't give me any time to think on the solutions, as he was constantly saying "Implement! Implement! We are running out of time." I guess he was testing my response to stressful situations... The first interview (that was skipped) was rescheduled to another day. This one, that was supposed to be the first one, went much better. She asked about my background and goals, and also allowed some time for my questions. There was also some technical questions involved. I passed the two interviews, and another one was scheduled with the project manager. He asked me some more questions, related with the project in which he was working.

1. Applied online and received a request to do an interview with them about a week later. Emails to recruiters usually takes a day or so to get a response, but is often much faster (maybe half an hour when our timezone align). 2. Two phone interviews, 45 min each with engineers. There were no personality interviews during the preliminary interview. 3. Once you pass the preliminary interview, you are in the process for team matching. At the team matching interview, they still don't ask many behavioral questions. There's sometimes easy technical questions (e.g. how would you find the min element of a BST) to see your coding style.

I applied online where I submitted my CV and was contacted after a day. I was working during that time, so my two phone interviews were scheduled on the same day and the recruiter was really helpful in making sure I can make the time. The phone interviews were 15 minutes apart and the first one had a lot of small questions that required no coding, but rather collaboration on how I might do things as well as questions about data structures. On one of the questions I did not entirely understand what I was asked and the interviewer explained what was expected. The second interview was a single coding exercise. I had to write a solution to a given problem and after I wrote it, I had to explain the complexity of my solution. After that I was asked to improve my algorithm so that it runs faster. The interviewer did not require the code to be compilable, but to show knowledge of the language and the solution. Off the top of my head I did not remember the exact way of doing I/O with files in Java, but that was not a problem. After the interviews I was contacted the following day and the recruiter informed me that I am continuing to the next stage where they search for a project for me. The project was found in a couple of days and I had a phone conversation with the team manager who asked me about my previous experience with some technologies and my availability for the needed dates. After that I was given my offer in another couple of days. Through all the experience the recruiter made sure I was informed of what is coming next and what I need to expect.

The most difficult part was to improve my solution in the second interview, which was not hard by itself, but when put on the spot it is harder to think of another way to solve it.   Answer Question

My first contact with Google was attending an info session that they hosted at my university. At the end of the info session, then they had mini 3 minute interviews with anyone who was interested. During the mini interview, I gave the Google engineer I was talking to my resume, and he asked me questions about my experiences with software development up until that point. A little later, I was contacted by Google and told that they wanted to schedule a real interview with me for a summer internship. This interview consisted of two back to back 45 minute sessions, each which started out with a few broad questions then narrowed down to solving a specific interview problem. After that, Google contacted me a little while later again saying that I'd been offered an internship for that summer.

First, a small group of staffers interviews the candidates. Then a second committee reviews all materials about the applicants, including those they submitted on their own behalf as well as interviewer feedback.

But that’s not the only way analytics have shaped the process. Google used to conduct many interviews before settling on a job candidate and making an offer. But through analytics, the company has determined that after four interviews, they don’t achieve a much greater degree of confidence about whether the interviewee is a good fit for a position. As a result, they’ve capped the number of interviews that they’ll put a candidate through. Data also have led Google to conclude that speed is of the essence when it comes to hiring recent graduates.   Answer Question

The interview consisted of two technical 45 minute phone calls, which is the same for every applying intern. The first interviewer was difficult to understand (talked softly, had an accent), but I did much better in this interview than the second. First he asked a general question about my computer science studies, then two big coding questions. I did not completely finish them but walked him through how I would finish them since I was pressed for time. The second interviewer was friendlier and easy to understand, but asked a very difficult coding question that took me the whole interview. He had to talk me through most of the problem and the code still wasn't completely done at the end. There is no specific way to prepare for these interviews, as anything relevant you learned in the past few years can be asked. I'd suggest reviewing any data structures or algorithms you have had a hard time with in the past. Also, come prepared with questions to ask the interviewer at the end.

I learned of summer internship opportunities at Google through a panel at my school. After filling out the online application, which included nothing more than basic information like major, project interests, and unofficial transcripts, I was contacted by email by a recruiter to set up a series of two back-to-back phone interviews. These interviews were technical in nature. The first interview required me to design and describe algorithms but did not require any actual coding. There was also a more general design question about how I would go about adding a new feature to one of the company's products. The second interview required live coding in a shared document. After passing these technical interviews, I went into the host matching phase, where my information is placed into a database for the perusal of possible hosts. I was soon contacted by my recruiter, who told me that a host had selected me for a possible internship. My recruiter set up a phone interview with my host, who asked me a few technical questions, but he was satisfied with broad descriptions of general approaches rather than the more technical explanations required for my previous interviews. My recruiter then contacted me to inform me that I had passed the host matching interview and extended an offer for summer employment.

During the interview, I was asking to provide some gode on a google doc, and also reply on the fly to some technical question.

I applied through my uni's career center , later they contacted me telling me that they would like to schedule a phone interview , some software engineer called me all the way from zurich and it was pretty easy at first it wasnt intimidating at all , questions about my goals and personality more or less . after that she contacted me a week later telling me that they scheduled a technical interview through google docs online , that was pretty INTENSE , questions were not easy at all and they would probably even weed out a good candidate if he is nervous enough . they offered me the job but i ended up declining it cause i had other plans.

I had two phone interviews in the same day. first interviewer was nice, second had VERY heavy accent. couldn't understand half of the time what he was asking, but he was nice too. questions were pretty standard: data structures, algorithms, design patterns. I had to write code in google docs.

I had two technical interviews over phone. The first interviewer asked me to solve two graph related problems, and the second one asked me about finding the intersection of two lists of integers, leading on to the case where the lists are too big to fit into the memory. I think I gave correct solutions, but botched on asymptotic running time of one of the graph problems.

I submitted my resume online, I got an email saying they would be interested in interviewing me. They scheduled two 45 minute interviews over a two hour period We were to use the phone and Writely (aka Google Docs) Oddly enough they referred to it as Writely. The interviewers were both engineers, they called me but Writely did not work so we spend 10 minutes during each interview trying to get it to work. They were both nice about it not working, no snide comments etc. We ended up using Google Talk, I would post my code and she her comments and/or questions. They asked about my research, then a few softballs followed by one or two questions. The second interviewer also explained the Google interviewing process, and what I should expect next. The questions were tricky, and I was not feeling confident afterwards. A few weeks later, I sent the recruiter an email asking for an update then she responded with another phone interview this time for a specific position, with a hiring manager (host). He called me, he described his project, which I had looked up when the recruiter told me the group. He also described the position, which I was a bit bleh about - he noticed that. We asked about my background then did a bit of role play - how would you do X, etc. I emailed the recruiter a synopsis of the interview as she had asked. A few weeks later, she said she was still trying to find me a good host at Google.

I applied on the Google website, a few days later got an email saying they wanted to two technical phone interviews. After those, there was a month period where I had to be matched up with a host. Then just another interview with him, and I got the offer. They had come to my college, and I also handed my resume to a recruiter, not sure if that had anything to do with it at all.

At first I received a phone interview to discuss what sort of areas of software development I was interested in, a little bit about my background, why I thought I would be a good fit for Google and also received a few questions regarding some common programming questions. This was then followed by a one on one phone interview with an Engineer from Google who asked me some general problem solving questions, such as how to implement a queue simply using two stacks and how to implement a highly efficient queue using two stacks and another question about calculating the max execution time of a program that had to fit into a certain size of memory on an embedded device.

Two phone interviews on the same day. Both were very technical. The first interview consisted of programming questions. The ultimate question was a bit manipulation problem, and I had to code it in Google docs, while the interviewer could read my code. The second interview consisted of design questions. I was to design a software library, something about a histogram. It involved defining classes, subclasses, and methods.
