2013-01-25 20:32:33.33,got in touch with with google through a campus recruiting event  talked to the recruiter and she told me to turn it in online. a month or two later i was sent an email saying that i had gotten an interview  i was so excited. i had two phone interviews  that were supposed to be 45 minutes long each with a 15 minute break between them. the first interviewer called me 15 minutes late so that was a little annoying. we didn t chit chat or anything and got straight to the problem  which was a board game problem  i won t go further because i don t want to breach my nda . when my interviewer asked me the question  my mind went blank and i had no idea how to solve it right away so i just talked my way through it. overall i felt i didn t do too well on this question and i took almost whatever time i had left in the interview to solve this problem. the second interviewer called about 1 2 minutes after the first interviewer hung up and he talked about what he did a little bit and then we got down to the problem solving. again  i don t want to breach my nda so i can t really say what my question was. i thought i solved this problem pretty well and it sounded like my interviewer was fine with my solution. we then talked about another problem and rather than having me code it  he just asked me to describe how i would solve it. after i did this  i asked him some questions about his history and what it was like to work at google and then we ended the interview about 5 minutes early because we were more or less done. it took google about 3 weeks to get back to me  it was a dreaded wait  however i knew after the first interview i wasn t going to get an offer. i felt that to get an internship you needed to blow both the interviews out of the park and i felt like i barely got by the first one and blew the second one out of the park  which wasn t going to be enough. overall  i was really nervous because this was my first interview with a big name company and i feel like that really got to me in the first interview. even though i didn t get an offer  it was really good practice because i ended up interviewing at microsoft and i learned what not to do in the interview  like be nervous  . i was able to remain calm during my microsoft interview and i ended up getting an offer there  which i don t think i would have been able to do unless i had this interview with google.,first interview  board game question second interview  one coding question  honestly i can t remember it for the life of me   and one technical question where i was asked how i would solve it   answer question

2013-01-26 13:00:44.057,the process started when i applied for a software engineering intern position online. the online application was relatively simple and included basic information such as name  address  education  work experience etc. it took approximately 2 weeks after submitting my online application before a recruiter contacted me to schedule 2 phone interviews. after several emails sent back and forth  both interviews were scheduled  one right after the other. both interviewers were very nice and helpful during the interview. each interview was between 40 and 50 minutes long. i had heard that sometimes the interviewers can be condescending and distant  but this was not the case in my interviews. both interviewers were very sincere and talked me through the whole process.,i am going to respect my non disclosure agreement that i signed with google. just know your basic data structures  algorithms  and be prepared to think on your feet.   1 answer
2013-01-04 14:35:26.267,submitted my resume online and was contacted within a week by my recruiter. she set up two 45 minute interviews for 3 weeks later. the interviews were back to back. i can t give details about the questions because of the nda  but the first dealt mainly with common data structures and algorithms   any computer science major should have been able to easily code the solutions. i got through about 6 questions with a few bugs along the way  mainly because of nerves  but the interviewer was very nice about pointing them out and giving me an opportunity to correct them. the second interview did not go nearly as well. i got stumped on the first question and ended up spending all 45 minutes on it  it shouldn t have been very hard  but it dealt with a concept i hadn t thought about for a while so i didn t know where to begin. the interviewer was not particularly friendly or helpful  he would correct my code as i wrote it which was a bit annoying and nerve wracking  but overall wasn t mean. by the end of the 45 minutes i had a working  although not at all elegant  solution. seeing as my second interview went so terribly i was shocked when i received an email the next day from my recruiter saying i made it to the host matching phase. i was in google purgatory for 3 and a half long weeks before i heard back from a potential host in boulder  co. my recruiter set up an interview for the following week. the host interview hardly felt like an interview  it was very conversational and was mostly him telling me about the position. he ended the phone call basically telling me i had the job  about 5 minutes later i received a congratulatory email from my recruiter  and was given the official offer the next day.,during the host interview  what is your favorite least favorite thing about the java language    answer question

2013-09-24 10:46:23.55,contacted by hr and had 2 technical phone interviews. the first interviewer had a strong accent which has been a really big problem during the whole interview. he was trying to give tips and i made him type in google doc where i had to code. second interviewer was great  we talked a lot about the company and he was laughing to the jokes i made. questions were simple  don t study too much just repeat the data structures and test cases to verify the correction of your code. recruiters send an email telling you what to go over  it has bunch of stuff written you don t need to get frustrated  because they re way too complex and you will be never asked to implement them in 45 minutes.,none of the questions were difficult  just basic data structure questions.   answer question

2012-12-25 06:16:43.97,an employee at google helped me submit my resume to their referral system. two days later a recruiter contacted me and asked me to fill some standard forms about my location preference and skills. then another recruiter asked me preferred dates for two telephone interviews. there were two 45 minute interviews and the interviewer were very well prepared. very standard data structure and algorithm coding problems. they helped me throughout the whole process. make sure that you think aloud and tell them your thoughts and concerns. do not hesitate to ask them if there s anything not clear. although i made some mistakes and got the final correct answer code after a lot of their hints  i was noticed one day after my interview that i had passed. then was the host matching process. someone including me  may think that if apply early  we would get an offer for internship if we can pass the tech interviews because google would match you to different hosts until summer. but this was not the case. now they have a new policy. if the recruiter can t find a host that shows interest to the candidate within several weeks  the intern will be rejected. it seems a lot of candidates who pass the tech interviews can t get an offer because no match can be found. after a host showed interest to me  we had a non technical phone talk  which was about half an hour. he first asked some experiences on my resume. then introduced his project and asked if i was interested. we were both satisfied and two days later my recruiter told me she will prepare an offer. one more week later i got a phone call from the recruiter about the offer and two more days later i got the offer letter. it s an intern position at mountain view. satisfied and accepted immediately.,no unexpected question   answer question

2014-05-05 02:25:11.803,applied online before christmas  didn t expect to hear back at all  but in late january got an email and 2 45 minute technical interviews over the phone were scheduled. a couple of days before the first interview  i contacted the recruiter as i wasn t confident i have had enough time to prepare. my interview was pushed back a week  which was extremely nice of google. in the first inverview  i was asked to code a very basic  well known algorithm but the interviewer did not specify that in the question  it was more like  how would you do this   type question. then i was asked to walk through a sample input and explain how the algorithm would execute. finally i was asked how i would adequately test the algorithm. second question involved coming up with a solution to a problem involving 2 integer arrays. no coding was required  just an explaination of how i would go about it. second interviewer had me explain some object oriented concepts  even though i chose to answer in c. there were some ambigious questions about the google search engine and the google servers  which i m pretty sure i did not answer correctly. then i was asked to write an encryption function  and once i managed to complete it  the problem was made more difficult a couple of times and for each i had to rewrite the code to suit the problem. overall  i thought the interviews were not as hard as i thought they would be  and both of the interviewers were quite nice and patient  explaining concepts i did not understand  or helping me find the right solution. at the end of each interview i had some time to just chat with them  and ask questions  which i thought was great.,how does the google search engine work    2 answers
