I initially applied online and it took about two months to actually get called back. Once I got called back though, the process went very quickly! First, I was contacted for a phone screening that was pretty straightforward with a few behavioral questions and technical questions that felt like they were read off of a paper. After passing the phone screening I was contacted two days later with a second more technical phone screening. It also had a few behavioral questions and a few questions that actually asked me how I would design a program. A couple days after that, I was contacted for a flight out to the Intel campus for an in person interview. The flight scheduling was really nice, Intel covered everything (flight, hotel, car rental, food). The on campus interview was rather intense, not because it was hard but because it was draining. It started at 8:00 AM and I had interviews with 9 people (mostly 1 hour, but two were half hour) ending at 5:00 PM. The on campus interviews tended to always start with a behavioral question or two, then they would lead off into technical questions. I was asked to write code on a whiteboard, locate bugs in some printed code, write code on paper, and how I would design certain solutions (sometimes with code and sometimes with just a high level overview). The Intel campus was great! It was HUGE compared to what I'm used to. The campus had three food courts (which had some good food from the lunch that was provided for me), a spa and salon, massage therapist, gym (with karate and yoga classes at the moment, but I was told more are offered), play area (ping pong tables, pool tables, air hockey tables, and what's even better is people were actually playing!), US Bank branch (not just an ATM, but actually a desk with a teller), and health center with a doctor and nurses (you know, for all the injuries programmers get from typing. Actually, you can go there for all your regular checkups).

I was contacted by two different teams on the phone for a "get to know you" call. I received a technical follow-up call from one of the teams that did not go very well. It was my mistake that I wasn't very prepared. So study up on things you think you already know! Then I came in for long day of interviews with people from the other team. It was I think six different interviews ranging from technical puzzle to coding to questions on how I work with others. The environment was very relaxed, casual, and pretty comfortable. Because of my first screw-up on the phone I had put a week's worth of hard studying/reviewing so I was well prepared for these interviews, and they went really well.

I got referred by an acquaintance to the Windows OS team at Folsom. The overall interview process was around 3-4 weeks. I had an initial round of phone interview which concentrated on general operating system concepts. I was invited for an onsite interview at Folsom, CA. It was the worst experience that I have had in an interview. I think that the decision regarding hiring was made well before actually even interviewing me. There were 7 rounds of technical interviews. First round was good with generic discussion about my projects, operating system concepts etc. Second round was by an engineer with no proper communication skills, he was rude, unwilling to hear to my approach to problems. This was supossed to be a x86 coding round when I had no where listed that on my resume. Most of the rounds were primarily concentrated on computer architecture when I had very limited knowledge on the same. The interviewers seems very inconsiderate of the fact that I was a computer science student and not a CE student. The lunch interview was a pain, right from the moment we left the meeting room, till we came back the interviewer was constantly asking questions, with very limited time given to even have my food. I was expected to code on paper even the lunch interview round which seemed pretty insane to me. The worst part was the same team at Hillborough had no CE questions at all that were asked while interviewing the candiates.

I was very impressed that the process moved so fast. No delays. The whole process took a fraction of the time it would take at other big companies. Had two rounds of phone interviews then was called onsite. At the onsite interview I had 7 rounds of interviews, one hour each. The first was with senior manager and focused on behavioral, goals questions and then basic questions from what I had written on my resume. The next 5 were technical. I was tested on C, Java because that was what I said I was most comfortable with. Questions ranged from knowledge of the language e.g questions about how the garbage collector in java works, to coding questions on trees, pointers, recursion, string manipulation, arrays etc. Some interviewers also asked computer architecture questions e.g. caches, superscalar processor design etc... The last meeting was with project manager. Asked few questions concerning whether I liked group members and projects being worked on. All in all the interviewers were very focused, professional, bright and helpful. It felt more like an interesting intellectual conversation than an interview.

Applied online for several positions at a smaller Intel facility (~100 people). Took about 6 weeks for them to contact me by email saying they were interested. I then had a 30 minute phone screening which was primarily discussing my background. I was not asked to solve any technical problems. I heard back within a couple days that they wanted me for an onsite interview. Onsite interview was 4 hours long and consisted of meeting 6 people, two managers, two team leads, and two engineers. Mostly discussed my background and quizzed me on it. Engineers had some design questions for me. Notably not asked any algorithms questions. Finally I took a written test where I had to analyze and write some different code fragments. Was not difficult.

I always have difficulty answering the more personal questions - "What makes you frustrated at work" The technical part of the interview was not challenging for me because I had a strong background in the material.   2 Answers

Had a phone interview with many small questions related to computer architecture, operating systems and programming. Then offered onsite interview. Onsite interview was with 5 different people. Each kind of tried to cover different topics. Again questions came from computer architecture (i/o, memory hierarchy etc.), operating systems (cache consistency, virtual memory etc.), programming (c,c++,assembly). Last interviewer asked more general questions what would you do if you were in this case, what do you think about future of computers etc.

Not about being difficult but they kind of tried to focus on and ask about things that I haven't mentioned in my resume or told them on phone interview such as virtualization, assembly programming etc. If you were looking for someone who already have experience with all of those you shouldn't have invited me for onsite. Or at least do not take them into account and look whether I can learn them or not.   Answer Question

I applied for a contract position here and I was interviewed by a manger who has 16 years experience at Intel, Portland. I have a experience of 5 years in the software industry and I was applying for jobs after a 2 years break in my career due to family reasons. I had worked on a startup idea and built and published an app and that was my recent experience. The manager just started off by belittling my skills and experience. His exact words were "Why did it take you so long to complete and publish this application? Wasn't there any one behind you with a stick (to beat you) while you were working on this app? ". I was horrified by the language used by the interviewer and I never followed up with them with the next steps after this experience. I was not asked many technical questions or anything about my previous experience. I don't know what was wrong with this interviewer or if any other interviewer was shadowing him, but I also found him giggling and talking while I was answering his questions. If they did not find my skills aligned to the position during the interview or if they already found another candidate for this position, there was a dignified and decent way of letting me know about it. I found an amazing opportunity with a company larger than Intel and I am very happy at my current position.

Applied through Intel's website...... After a few weeks was contacted by the Hiring Manager...The Manager of the group where I applied.... Asked me questions regarding my CV.... asked about few projects that I had on my CV... then some behavioral questions...but no technical questions... Then informed me that I will have 1 or 2 technical interviews..... The only problem I had with the procedure was that one of the interviewer send me an email without explicitly telling me that it is the same position I already had my pre-technical interview and asked me for sometime on the same day.... I took it as a pre-technical interview of another position... (as I applied for multiple Intern positions so I wasnt sure).... My mistake was to accept the interview request.... I wasnt ready for it at that time.. and I was not properly informed.

Met recruiter, who happened to be the US Intern Program Manager in the US for Intel, at a resume workshop here on MIT campus. We spoke for a bit about my resume and he told me I should apply to intern at Intel so I did. I corresponded with him over email here and there and gave him updated versions of my resume (in response to critique he gave during the resume workshop). After a month or two he said he was ready to start the interview process and the way it worked is that he tried to match me to a group so I was supposed to interview with individual groups. The guy from the interview really liked me I guess and I only got to interview for his group, Intel Architecture Group. Questions were very easy/standard: What is a class. Difference between Abstract class and Interface. What is polymorphism and why is it useful. Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy. VTables. A very simple (algorithm?) question:

I applied initially to Intel job site for this position. I got a call from team member who did initial screen interview for 30 mins. He verified my experience and asked few basic technical questions. After that I got a call from recruiter saying I need to be in San Jose for technical interview with team in 1 week. They made all arrangements for travel and stay. On the interview date I met with the team and had one to one interview with each team members. We quickly realized that my skills were different from what they were looking for. All in all, very good experience. Would defiantly consider Intel for future opportunities. One more advice, if you are going for software position in device and platform team, make sure you know basics of operating systems very well.

Contacted by a recruiter, talked for 5 minutes about general stuff... my interests, what the position is about, the group at Intel. A week later I was notified that they would like me for an on-site interview in a week. At the on-site interview I met with 7 people during one morning... 8am-12pm. This being a Software Engineering position I expected at least some technical questions, but I received none! The only technical question was one casual "can you code?". To which I replied yes of course. Every interviewer asked me what I did for my PhD and we generally talked about my work. It seems that the most important thing for them was to determine whether I'll be a good fit with my vision, interests and prior experience. I would say personality is definitely another thing they look for even though you may not notice it. People in this group seemed pretty young and open minded... especially the group leader (boss). The position in itself wasn't really the "code in the trenches" kind and it has quite a bit of flexibility and requires creativity and novel approaches. Perhaps that's why they were more interested in the vision and interests than coding.

Why would you be a good fit to this group?   Answer Question Questions about my PhD work where I had to justify my decisions. They were difficult because the questions were coming from a different perspective than I would typically meet in academia.   Answer Question

The interview comprises of a telephonic round and an on-site interview. Both had questioned related programming. Intel heavily relies on Microsoft technologies, so knowing them is a plus. Phone interview comprised of few verbal technical questions and then i was asked to code a small program. The time allotted was 15 min. The code was judged on thought process, clarity of concepts and how easy it was to understand for a fellow developer. Onsite interview comprised of 7-8 rounds with a lunch break. It went from 8 am to 5 pm. There was one behavioral round, two problem solving rounds and all others were technical coding rounds. Though the interview process defer from team to team, there is no set pattern. i have seen people get jobs based on 1 hour onsite interview.

what would you do if you were managing a team and the team was unable to solve a problem technically and the deadline was approaching, will you sit down and code it yourself, be furious at the team,blame them for failure and complain to upper management etc. The follow up was , what will your do if you had two months before your next project started.

Was initially contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn and set in my resume. Several weeks later was contacted by Intel for a phone interview. The interview was scheduled for the following Monday. It consisted of some very basic questions about programming and software engineering as well as some behavioral questions. The interviewer's manager called me later that day for a follow up interview and the day after that (Tuesday) they scheduled me for a full day on-site interview for that Thursday. The on-site interview consisted of eight one hour interviews, one of them over lunch. They asked a lot of technical questions about a variety of topics, many behavioral questions, and I covered the whiteboard in the conference room with code several times. I have been selected, but the HR manager has been out for the week and will be contacting me on Monday to present an offer.

Unlike interviews I had at other tech companies, this interview focused more on your background and the specific skills required for this job. Algorithmic and oddball questions were rare. Most of the questions were on knowledge of c# and c languages and some data structure questions. This may not be the same for other interviews though. I was also a college recruit.

I applied online and about 3 weeks later received an email requesting a phone interview. The phone interview was basically the manager talking about the position and asking some questions about my background and a few technical questions; this phone interview lasted about 30 minutes. I was immediately invited to do two technical phone interviews with team members, which I did the next day. The first technical phone interview was only about 25 minutes, and I was asked mostly general (although fairly difficult) C++ questions. The second technical phone interview was about 1 hour and was almost entirely architecture questions, several of which went quite in depth. About 2 hours later I was invited for an on-site interview. About 2 weeks later I went to Santa Clara for the on-site interview. They flew me down on a Sunday, the interview was on Monday, and I left on Tuesday. The interview was about 5 hours. My first 1:1 interview was an hour long with a team member, and he mostly asked about various C++ and OOP topics. The second 1:1 interview was also an hour and mostly involved me writing code (C and assembly) on paper to solve a few problems. Next I had a half hour interview with the manager, who asked a few technical questions, but mostly told me about the benefits. Then was a 1:30 hour lunch with the team. After that I had a one hour discussion with a team member, which was fairly casual conversation about the position and team and area (no hard or technical questions). Finally I had another half hour interview with the manager and he mostly told me about what they were looking for and I tried to sell myself. I was told t hey would let me know within one week. A week later I got a phone interview from HR offering me the position.

It was a very positive experience. The interviewers were familiar with my resume. They asked me to talk about some of my prior projects. There were some simple clarifying questions about my role. They told me about their work and asked in some cases how would I do certain things at a high level. Their was one unpleasant interviewer from a different group who was basically accusing me of lying on my resume. I politely stood my ground and I assumed correctly that probably people don not take his opinion seriously.

The only thing that bothered me was that there long silent pauses on his side after I answered a question, I guess it's there to make you doubt your answers.

Most questions were relevant to the materials on my resume, but some were very odd and slightly confusing. The first phone interview was very basic stuff. They wanted to know what types of projects I've worked on for the most part. The second one was more technical and had a lot of process based questions as well as generic software engineering methodology questions. The on site interviews took up an entire day. They were hitting all the major points on my resume.

Contacted by manager, which reviews selected applications given from HR (new grad). Not sure if this is "typical" but here was the process. 1st Interview (TeamManager/Director) - Behavioral questions, background, team work, qualifications (non-technical), & personality. 2nd Interview (Team Lead) - Extensive background picking (projects, people, & situations). 3rd Interview (Engineer) - Skills assessment (basic to intermediate language specific questions), be sure to know the languages you claim (at the LEAST, know the basics, i.e. strengths, etc). 4th Interview (Senior Team Lead) - Literally went through everything on the resume, asking questions. Also asked technical questions in relation to areas you claim you know. Gave background of the team, problems they face. 5th Interview (TeamManager/Director) - Determine goals, and interest in continuing position. No on-site interview occurred (I'm out of state), but the phone interview process was very exhaustive. Personally, I loved the interview process and if you find yourself struggling, you shouldn't be applying (yet) in that area. HR didn't get "in the way". Friendly, and did a decent job of listening to concerns and following the schedule.

A week later they had me fly down to Intel site for Face to Face interview. It consisted of an hour long face to face interview with 6 people each. They ranged from junior engineers to senior engineers to engineering managers. Overall the interview was mostly technical, related to programming, OS, etc. and also about my master's thesis. If you are ever interviewed at Intel, AZ, make sure you thoroughly prepare for technical interview as that's what counts in the end. Prepare for questions related to personality and analytical quiz.

Initially I got a call from an HR@Intel and she asked me to apply for a position online and I did. I was then contacted from an Intel Hiring Manager and he told me that his team would be conducting phone interviews that very same day. I got interviewed from Interviewer1 (1hour) and then the very next hour by interviewer2. The hiring manager called me the next day and told me that two other team members would like to interview me. So again I had 2 interviews (1hour each) on that day. Later this day the manager called me and told me that he wants me to come onsite for an interview and I went there and Intel paid for all costs. I had 4 hour of interviews in 1 hour slots. I did also have lunch with the manager. It was all good. But after the onsite round, Intel haven't got back to me. I did call my manager and he said that he will inform me when the process is done. Thankfully the manager has been accommodating.

One of them even insisted on me answering the question on why I'd applied, and the answer "for job experience" couldn't satisfy him, although it was completely true for me. He even proceeded to calling me a "typist" for wanting to be a programmer. They referred to me with kind of a derogatory term mildly translated as "young lady" and were unhelpful at best. After all the struggle they gave me a number of technical questions. The whole process took more than four hours.

I have gone through Intel India interview process during placements in our college. There was CPI based shortlisting then 4 rounds of interviews were to be done. The first round of interview was based on C++/C/Java basics and other coding questions with some questions on project I have done. The next round was again a technical round in which they asked me solve puzzle, do some coding problems and some detailed discussion on research projects. The third round was more of a behavioral round in which we were given situations and we need to respond with what we would do in that situation. All others went through one more round, but I was taken 3 rounds and sent back. I was thinking that, they rejected me, finally when results were declared, I was selected :)

The longest interview I have attended till date. Most of the questions were from my resume about past projects and a couple of basic question about linked lists (insert, delete). Hypothetical questions like what technology would you use if you have to count the occurrence of all the words from wikipedia within a day. A question on what kind of interaction would you have if you want to recommend products to a user The interview was unusual in the manner it was conducted. The entire time about 3-4 hours was about the resume content.

It was only one interview on-site, which I'd scheduled with manager (on phone) the week before. During the interview, there were three people asking question, most of them were really easy and required only basic C++ and coding skills (types of casts, heap vs stack, constructors, virtual functions, etc.). Atmosphere was quite friendly. Be prepared to express your salary expectations (I would recommend to aim high as the salary is up to manager most of the time).

My application process began with a few managers coming to my university to give a presentation about the company. I left my resume with them and a week later i got an email that they would like to conduct a phone interview with me. The entire process consisted of a phone interview, progamming assignment, and finally an in person interview. Phone Interview: My reviewer called me up and gave me a variety of questions ranging from standard software topics like data structures; hardware topics, like how an interrupt works; and standard cs math like converting to hex etc.. Programming assignment After i completed the interview, I got a call back from another manager, with a relatively simple programming assignment that i was to complete by the next day. The assignment should only take a couple hours at most. In person: finally, a couple weeks later I was flown out to the company where i had 4 1 hour interviews, with a lunch break half way through. The interviews each had a specific theme, software, hardware, testing and design, and behavioral. None of the tests were particularly challenging, but as always, they are much harder on the spot. Most of the tester's made an effort to not react to any of the answers given during the interview, so it's hard to tell how successful you were until its over. The facilities were very nice, aside from workstations being small cubicles. During lunch while talking with the managers, i got the sense that there was a genuinely good work culture at the company, and that Intel was a very family friendly company, despite some of the criticism I had heard about on other websites.
