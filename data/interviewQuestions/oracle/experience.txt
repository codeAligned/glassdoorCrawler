Talked with recruiter and immediately was invited on site. I was recommended by a friend who is an Oracle employee so maybe that got me past the screening process. Met with the team for mostly laid back interviews. There was a coding problem on a computer with an editor and the ability to look up details online while programming. Then they asked you about the time and space complexity of your solution. There was also a white board coding interview and a few behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time when..."). There was a second phase where I would have brought a coding sample to discuss and give a white board technical talk, but I decided not to come in for round 2.

The questions were similar to those in Cracking the Coding Interview or one of the other popular books. Definitely worth studying if you are rusty on your undergraduate level algorithm design.   Answer Question

Met with 3 Groups on 2 different days. Oracle people are very nice, from Recruiters to managers. They managed to create a pleasant conversational environment and never put pressure on you. Very few technical questions, the process is quite smooth. They arranged lunch with two alumni, very informative and considerate. But they raise a high bar for selecting candidates for onsite. I think this is why Oracle interview is easy but still can hire talented people.

It depends on groups that are interested in you. Some groups asks algorithm coding questions while others place more emphasis on communication and behavior. Anyway, you can assume nothing in advance, be prepared for data structure, algorithms and basic technical questions. After all, for a software engineer position, the responsibility is to write code every day.   Answer Question

The recruiter contacted me about 2 weeks after I submitted application online(sent resume to an email address for internship). The recruiter asked for my updated resume and transcripts and then arranged a 5-minute phone chat with me. The phone chat is mainly about the overview of the internship and the interview process. And there is only one round phone interview for internship in Oracle. After a week, I was told to have an interview with a group and followed by another group one more week later. And got rejected an week after the second interview. One interviewer is not patient at all and not nice as what other people said. Another is almost no emotional(I can not feel whether he is happy or not about the answer)

Mostly are general behavior questions about the projects on the resume like: 1. what is your strength? 2. what is your weakness? 3. what's your hobby? 4. what do you think is the most challenge part in XX project? 5. what do you want to get from the internship? tell me about But also some basic technical questions like: 1. tell me about some sorting algorithms you know? 2. how will you find out a bug in the program   Answer Question

I sent my resume to the oracle recruiting email address, and got a reply from the HR. Later, she called me asking for some basic information. It was not like a phone interview. Then my resume was reviewed by groups in Oracle. About one month later, I got the onsite interview invitation with the group descriptions. Then I speak with five groups. Some groups are in Massachusetts, then the form would be a video interview. Video interviews were basically more technical. Others asked about the resume and projects I did in school, together with some small technical questions. They were not very hard. The time for each group was 1 hour and a quarter. And I speak with several persons in that group. Between successive interviews, there was a quarter for rest. Interviewers were very friendly, and made the interview more like a talking or discussion. Now I am still waiting for the response.

Got an email from the recruiter (had submitted the resume during the career fair). HR provided a list of groups out of which we can select any number depending on our interest. Interviewed with 4 groups (1 hour 30 min each) back-to-back and got an offer from one of the managers on that day itself. That turned out to be best possible scenario since I wanted to work with that group right from the day I had chosen the group as one of my potential interests. Questions involved identifying bugs in a code, deep OS questions, white-board coding. Rigorous but delightful.

The questions where very low level JAVA language questions. Questions like what is the Super class of all classes in JAVA. How does the class loader work. What are the different drivers in JDBC (he did want to know about JAVA JDBC Connectors so I do not know what he was referring to). The questions where mostly like this.

College hire process can vary from student to student. I have heard of students having a technical phone screen but my process was 20 minute HR screen --> Group Ranking from groups interested in hiring me --> HQ group interviews. The group interviews can vary from pure behavioral, white board coding, take home coding tests, and or a mixture of everything. Mine was more on the behavioral side so it was easier possibly. That hardest part is actually getting the first round interview. Oracle only hires from some 15 colleges from around the country (with some exceptions) and weigh GPA and work experience (internships / coops) higher than many would expect hence the interview process maybe very easy for many.

I turned in a paper resume at my college career fair and to my great surprise, received an email inviting me to travel for onsite interviews - no phone screen. I "interviewed" with 5 teams, but all of them viewed it as a foregone conclusion that I would be hired, and only asked really soft questions and told me about their teams! No coding tests at all, except one that was very clearly for their background info and not for a hiring decision (i.e., how much to train me). This was the most unexpected experience possible.

This was my first interview drive as an experience professional, Couldnt clear the interview but following are the 2 rounds which i have attended, 1) Written Test on the Java Objective( 1 hr) There were 60 question and we needed to answer it in an hour duration. Had prepared for this from a week and finally happy to get this round cleared with the highest score. most of the others also cleared so i presume the cut off was a bit low. 2) Technical Interview (1 Hr) Although it was called a technical interview , the first question itself made me loose all the hopes of getting a job. I was given 4 questions and out of which there is only 1 programming question which was a simple one on list. Rest all questions where of puzzle kind which really test your IQ and reasoning skills. interviewer gave some paper and asked me to answer in that , 45 min time was given to answer all the questions Well the interview process was bit disappointing as i dint get selected , But all said ,I am happy with my interview experience

Part of the college campus hiring program. Recruiter got resume through campus career event, contacted me. No phone screening, so it's all about good resume, in particular good school & GPA. I got a one day onsite interview at HQ, where I talked with 4, 5 teams. Since each teams has seperate hiring decision, if you got pick by recruiters for onsite interviews, very high chance that you will have at least one offer from at least one team out of the 5 teams you talked with. Actually interview really depended on which team. Some team is just casual talks, while some teams actually ask technical questions, but quite easy and more about personality & skill fit. No general algorithm questions. Be friendly & talkative. Prepare to talk about your past project & relevant experience, it's the main bonus points.

oracle App dev (oracle fusion) came to our campus. They took an online test which tested basic knowledge of ds,os,programming,dbms,grammar,apti and logical ability. the test was easy. They shortlisted around half of the candidates which had appeared for the test. The result of the test was declared after a week and a half and all the students shortlisted were to be a part of a pool campus drive to be taken place at iiit delhi. The interview process was unstructured and the recruiters behaved very unprofessionally. The ppt started 30 min late. The schedule was not announced beforehand, as a result of which most of the candidates had to wait for more than 6 hours even for the first round of interview. There was no uniformity in the difficulty level of the ques asked and the interviewers were asking random ques like write a code for solving so-do-ku or write code for solving a n*n tic tac toe. There was no uniform standard as some people were asked very easy ques like reverse a word. The interviewers seemed irritated and werent exactly polite. I was asked four questions in the first round. 1.there is a sorted array which has nos from 1 to 100.there is a missing no. Find that no without traversing the full array. 2.There is an array which consists of 1s and 0s. Shift all the 1s to right and 0s to left. 3.There is an array which consists of 1s and 0s and 2s. Shift all the 1s to right and 0s to left and 2s to the middle. 4. Reverse only the sequence of words in the string. The interviewer interviewed two candidates simultaneously. Which made the process very confusing. The interviewer seemed sleep deprived and sat with his head down during the time i coded the ques. He just wanted to get over with the process. He was unenthusiastic and demotivating. He told me to wait outside which was their code word for you have been selected for the next round. Twenty mins after the 1st round i was called for the second round. The interviewer dint even acknowledge me. He asked what ques i was asked in my previous interview and asked me to tell him about myself. He then told me to code towers of Hanoi. When i him to explain the problem he looked as if someone had struck him with a rod. He quickly explained the problem without divulging the fact that the blocks had to be picked up on by one. As a result i coded the problem wrong. He gave me this problem to solve and went out. He returned after 40 min and dint even apologize. He was in fact worse than the first interviewer. He saw the solution and then told me the detail which he had forgot to mention. i asked him to give me a few more min to code. He went outside again. this time he came after 10 min and i explained him the logic. He seemed satisfied with the logic but refused to give me more time to code. After that he told me "you are done for the day" which implied that i was eliminated. They dint even have the courtesy to say the exact words that you are eliminated from the process that and created a lot of confusion and embarrassment. Some people who were supposedly eliminated ended up staying a few hours extra thinking they were selected for the next round just because the interviewer used such ambiguous words and did not say clearly whether they were in for the next round or not. The whole interview experience was very bad.

1.there is a sorted array which has nos from 1 to 100.there is a missing no. Find that no without traversing the full array. 2.There is an array which consists of 1s and 0s. Shift all the 1s to right and 0s to left. 3.There is an array which consists of 1s and 0s and 2s. Shift all the 1s to right and 0s to left and 2s to the middle. 4.

First round was online technical and aptitude test. Tech. was tough. Aptitude was easy. Shortlisted students went through first interview round. Mostly OS and DSA related questions. It was around 40 min. After first interview we had final Tech. interview. I was shortlisted for second round. This was quite a long. Mine went for 1:30.

The first round in the recruitment process of Oracle was the written test. It was an online written test. The test consisted of 6 sections: logical reasoning, aptitude, programming, English and a 5 minute quick test. I cannot recall the 6th section. In 5 minute quick test section the questions were like finding the incorrect number in the given sequence of numbers or finding the next number in the given sequence of numbers and so on. In programming section the questions were from data structure and database management. However, not a lot of weightage was given to this section, even a candidate who had performed well in the other sections but not so well in the programming section qualified for the next round. Oracle shortlisted 40 students for the interview round. Interview: Round 1: Personal Interview In the interview I was asked some programming questions and some puzzles. Some of the programming questions were: What is binary search? Write down the code for the binary search for finding a number given a series of numbers. Finding the power of a number.
