2014-09-13 16:40:04.19,first was a hr   technical interview. spoke about 2 projects and answered questions on them. 25 min online technical interview. question was  given a pattern and a string   find if the string follows the same pattern eg  pattern    a b b a   string   cat dog dog cat  ,given a matrix of friend enemy relationship between a group of people  your goal is to figure out if two individuals have a particular relationship chain    039 friend of a friend  039     039 enemy of a friend  039   for example  consider when you have the following matrix of relationships  where f means   034 friend of  034  and e means   034 enemy of  034   and an entry at  x y  is the relationships between individual x and individual y   fe f f ef  in this example  individual 0 and individual 2 have a relationship chain e  eg. 0 lt    gt 2   but they also have the relationship chains ff  0 lt    gt 1 lt    gt 2  and effe  0 lt    gt 2 lt    gt 1 lt    gt 0 lt    gt 2 l that is cycles of relationships are possible. these relationships have the following properties  1. being friends and enemies are symmetric  so if person a is friend with person b that implies that person b is also friends with person a  similarly with enemies 2. a person cannot have a relationship to themself and so no relationshp chain will include 0 lt    gt 0 3. the only valid relationships are f  e  or    friend  enemy  or neither  given a matrix of size n x n  the indices for 2 individuals  and a relationshp chain as a string  return 1 this relationshp exists between 2 people and 0 if otherwise. this is the boilerplate function  i had to write the code for  n   number of people frenemy is the relationship type x   index of person a y   index of person b relationship   def is frenemy n  frenemy  x  y  relationship     answer question

2014-11-14 10:37:04.397,i applied at a career fair and had a 30 minute technical interview in person the next day. the question was straightforward asking to find the possible permutations of a string  and i wrote up the code on a laptop due to lack of a whiteboard  but the style was the same as whiteboard coding. a couple days later  i received an email to set up a 1 hour phone interview. i was asked how to find duplicate files in a filesystem  and i wrote up the code on coderpad. another few days later  i received an email to set up an on site interview. this consisted of three technical interviews  lunch with an engineer  and an engineering q a. the questions were interesting and a bit more challenging than your average interview. be sure to be able to analyze space complexity in terms of bytes  not just big o notation. i don t think i can disclose the actual questions asked during the on site  but they were all fairly straightforward and did not require fancy algorithm or data structure knowledge. while i did solve all the questions and follow ups  i don t think we were always on the same page  and the interviewer had to nudge me in the direction they were hoping to go in. i received an email less than a week later telling me that i would not be receiving an offer.,list all duplicate files in a filesystem given the root directory.   answer question

2014-10-01 21:17:59.707,a friend  who had interviewed with dropbox previously  but no offer  introduced me to the recruiter via email. the recruiter responded about two weeks later and sent me a hackerrank coding question. i didn t think it would be very difficult  since i ve completed hackerrank coding questions previously for other companies with ease. oh  how very naive i was. the question was very difficult  for me at least . it was a pattern matching question which seemed like i was supposed to code up a lexical analyzer in an hour... based on what i ve read on glassdoor  other candidates went straight to either hr screening interviews or technical interviews. i believe i was given an exceptionally hard coding challenge question so that the recruiter could say they gave me a chance but they weren t going to bother with me unless i was extremely smart. it was really just a courtesy coding challenge an they had already decided to reject me. seeing as how i was recommended by a previously rejected candidate  i suppose i should seen their veiled rejection coming  in the form of a coding challenge . i m really disappointed at the dropbox recruiting practice. i ve worked at microsoft before and interviewed at google  facebook  square  twitter  airbnb  pinterest  etc.  and i ve never had this sort of treatment.,question was  given a pattern and a string input   find if the string follows the same pattern and return 0 or 1. examples  1  pattern    abba   input   redblueredblue  should return 1. 2  pattern   aaaa   input   asdasdasdasd  should return 1. 3  pattern   aabb   input   xyzabcxzyabc  should return 0. i saw someone else had a similar question  but it was much much easier as the other candidate was given spaces between words to help identify individual words to pattern match.   7 answers
