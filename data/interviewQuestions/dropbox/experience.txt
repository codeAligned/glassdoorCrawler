First was a HR / technical interview. Spoke about 2 projects and answered questions on them. 25 min online technical interview. Question was "Given a pattern and a string - find if the string follows the same pattern Eg: Pattern : [a b b a], String : cat dog dog cat "

Given a matrix of friend/enemy relationship between a group of people, your goal is to figure out if two individuals have a particular relationship chain (&#039;friend of a friend&#039;, &#039;enemy of a friend&#039;) For example, consider when you have the following matrix of relationships, where F means &#034;friend of&#034; and E means &#034;enemy of&#034;, and an entry at (x,y) is the relationships between individual x and individual y: -FE F-F EF- In this example, individual 0 and individual 2 have a relationship chain E (eg. 0&lt;--&gt;2), but they also have the relationship chains FF (0&lt;--&gt;1&lt;--&gt;2) and EFFE (0&lt;--&gt;2&lt;--&gt;1&lt;--&gt;0&lt;--&gt;2)l that is cycles of relationships are possible. These relationships have the following properties: 1. Being friends and enemies are symmetric, so if person A is friend with person B that implies that person B is also friends with Person A, similarly with enemies 2. A person cannot have a relationship to themself and so no relationshp chain will include 0&lt;--&gt;0 3. The only valid relationships are F, E, or - (friend, enemy, or neither) Given a matrix of size n x n, the indices for 2 individuals, and a relationshp chain as a string, return 1 this relationshp exists between 2 people and 0 if otherwise. This is the boilerplate function, I had to write the code for: n = number of people frenemy is the relationship type x = index of person A y = index of person B relationship = def is_Frenemy(n, frenemy, x, y, relationship):   Answer Question

I had previously applied to an internship or something at Dropbox and so I had the contact information for my college's recruiter so during the summer I reached out and told her I was interested in applying to a full-time role. She sent me a coding challenge later where I had 60 minutes to complete the activity. It wasn't too bad, just a BFS with some modifications. I did well and so I moved on to a phone interview with 2 people asking questions. We briefly talked about my resume and then had another coding question, which I did not perform very well on. I think if I had done well, I would have had one more phone interview then onsite.

A recruiter found me on LinkedIn and was always in touch throughout the process. She was very helpful and friendly. I had two phone interviews, done on CoderPad. Both asked me about a previous project for ten minutes, then gave me an eng interview. They were friendly and happy to answer questions about Dropbox after. I passed them and went to an onsite interview, where I had three eng interviews, one demo session (an engineer showed off upcoming Dropbox products), and an hour-long culture fit interview where they got someone from my college to answer all my questions and take notes on what I asked/said. All the eng questions were already covered, or straight out of Cracking the Coding Interview. Overall everyone was very friendly and helpful. It took the recruiter 2 business days to get back to me after phone screens, and 1 week to give me the results of my onsite. I didn't get an offer, but I was told to apply again in a year and I certainly will.

About two weeks after submitting my resume, a Dropbox recruiter reached out to organize a phone screen. After establishing that I require a US visa and the application deadline is fast approaching, two phone interviews were scheduled back to back on the shortest possible notice. Within 24 hours, an invite to the headquarters was extended, and by the time weekend rolled around I was flown from Europe to San Francisco, expenses paid. I was encouraged to take a couple of days to rest, enjoy the city, and recover from the jet lag before interviewing. Once fresh and ready, I went through a full day of on-site interviews, including discussing past projects, hands-on coding, and data structures/algorithmic whiteboard questions. The day was intense, fast paced, and accentuated with the delicious Tuck Shop food and perfectly brewed coffee. The Dropbox interviewers were smart, yet approachable, knowledgable, yet humble. Within two hours of completing the interview, a preliminary offer was hinted at. After I flew home, a full offer was extended, negotiated on, and signed, all within a day. Essentially, everything happened at the speed of light.

I was called me on time for a coding interview via coderpad.io. The initial conversation was brief because the main interviewer joined Dropbox recently and had basically nothing to talk about w.r.t job experience, etc. The problem statement was simple, "Find all duplicate files by content in your filesystem." However, the question was somewhat awkward via coderpad.io because it involved I/O. I didn't know what to expect from traversing a real filesystem via coderpad.io. I have experience working with low level filesystem design, so I tried to clarify the problem statement but didn't get much love (e.g.: http://wiki.osdev.org/File_Systems) To make things more confusing, the interviewer described the problem using a list of arrays that seemed the input of the problem. As a matter of fact, that was the expected output. I realized that because after 20 minutes working with it as input, he pasted the actual input as a tree. I ran out of time because I was basically designing my own index from the input (errr output) then doing a tree traversal.

The coding exercise can be started at anytime within one week from the day they sent it to you. My coding exercise was about developing an online class registration system. I had a bunch of related functions that I had to implement (add a class, remove a class, enroll a student, remove a student, etc), and they give you the specifics for each function. I didn't think it was very difficult, but it was kind of long so I didn't get to implement everything. You can compile and run your program right on the coding exercise page. There are also test cases, and it will tell you which test cases you passed, which ones you got wrong, and what should be the correct output for those.

The onsite interview was supposed to be 3 hours: with 2 coding interviews (1 hr each) and 1 behavioral interview (1 hr) My first interviewer, however, said that the original interviewer was sick and that he was filling in at the last moment. The first interview was originally supposed to be a specific front-end engineering interview. However, the questions asked were about algorithm design, data structures, etc and the interviewer didn't seem to want to discuss and sat there quietly. This was very unexpected. I was better prepared for the second interview which also focused on data structures and algorithms. After the second interview, I was told I was done for the day and that I would be called back for a deep-dive fronted-focused interview. They got in touch later to apologize and to restart the process by scheduling a 1-hr phone interview to give me another chance but I declined.

I was contacted by DropBox recruiter. After I spoke with the recruiter about opportunity and culture, I decided to submit the resume. The entire process was really pleasant and fast. I was scheduled for the phone interview within few days after submitting the resume. The initial phone interview was technical but there was no coding. It was more of screening and testing knowledge of the candidate in various technical area (system, parallel programming, networking, basic data structure, algorithm, web infrastructure, tech-stack). It wasn't hard but wasn't easy either. My advice is study and understanding tradeoffs. Interviewer actually looked into your resume and try to ask questions relevant to your area of expertise. First 15 minutes was introductory and the rest was breadth technical. The interview result was revealed a day after.

Received an email saying Dropbox saw my resume at a Hackathon and was interested in pursuing candidacy. I was sent a coding challenge to do online (I generally value NDAs, so I can't say, but it's for sure a question that was already posted to this site in other interview reviews), took an hour and a half and was more of a "build-from-scratch" kind of thing rather than a tough algorithms puzzle. I got 18/18 on it, and was emailed two days later to set up a phone interview. Phone interview, was asked a variation of the counting change problem, I wasn't quite able to code it up. Got the denial a few days later, as expected. Everyone was very nice and friendly, had a great chat with the interviewer also. I'd recommend giving this company a shot, there was NOT kool-aid at all like at most companies; just genuine engineers who seemed to want to hire great talent.

This was an initial phone screen. Very pleasant process. Was contacted by email by HR / Recruiting (two different people but handled seamlessly) who set up the phone screen. A last minute schedule conflict was quickly resolved and I was called at the appointed time. About 15 minutes of the screening was introductory / about them / about me. A few minutes were taken posing the problem and discussing, and intro to the online code sharing tool (linked to by HR in earlier emails).

Other reviewers have called out this problem. Should have worked through ahead of time. Also should have set up an empty project in my own environment that I could have pasted the initial problem definition into to (allowed, and would have saved time).

Spoke with an engineer at a career fair about my previous experiences and dropped off my resume. I was asked to sign up for a 30 minute on campus interview that night for the following day. Following the interview, I was asked to do another 60 minute interview the next day. Each of these was about 20% questions about goals and prior experience and 80% coding for the rest. After solving the problem I could ask questions about Dropbox as a company. In two days I was asked to visit SF office for a full-day interview, which was four one-hour interviews, each with one engineer and a shadow interviewer. Lunch with another guy in the middle, wrapped up with a 45-minute general Q+A. Each interviewer was very nice and helpful. They tried to present questions to which I already had some prior knowledge based on my completed coursework and experience, so I didn't particularly feel out of depth for any of it.

I applied at a career fair and had a 30 minute technical interview in person the next day. The question was straightforward asking to find the possible permutations of a string, and I wrote up the code on a laptop due to lack of a whiteboard, but the style was the same as whiteboard coding. A couple days later, I received an email to set up a 1 hour phone interview. I was asked how to find duplicate files in a filesystem, and I wrote up the code on coderpad. Another few days later, I received an email to set up an on-site interview. This consisted of three technical interviews, lunch with an engineer, and an engineering Q&A. The questions were interesting and a bit more challenging than your average interview. Be sure to be able to analyze space complexity in terms of bytes, not just big-O notation. I don't think I can disclose the actual questions asked during the on-site, but they were all fairly straightforward and did not require fancy algorithm or data structure knowledge. While I did solve all the questions and follow-ups, I don't think we were always on the same page, and the interviewer had to nudge me in the direction they were hoping to go in. I received an email less than a week later telling me that I would not be receiving an offer.

Applied for internship. First round interview was on-campus. Asked me to code a common simulation game that you may have heard of. Then asked me to scale it for a million inputs. Interviewer was on his phone while I was programming and not very interested in me beyond the code. Got a second phone interview 2 weeks later. Second guy was quite distracted too. Didn't sound very interested in interviewing me. He asked me a question floating around here on Glassdoor. I hadn't seen the question before but managed to solve it pretty easily. Then he changed it slightly and made it a lot harder. I quickly told him the solution to this which he agreed on and I proceeded to code a slightly inefficient solution. I think he was disappointed with my code and decided to ding me at this point. Questions were similar to Google, not impossible like others describe. Quite manageable. Overall, I got a negative impression from engineers at Dropbox. I met 2 other engineers at their office a while back too. Elitist and bro-culture are words I associate with them. That said, they have some very smart people. I actually like Google Drive as a product better, so I'm not sure what they do with all that engineering horse power.

Overall the interview was quite pleasant. The recruiters and each of the interviewers were very knowledgeable in their respective fields. Timing and scheduling worked liked clockwork. However, I was a bit surprised that they did not ask any technical questions. Perhaps they had already disqualified me at this point or perhaps the ball was in my court to demonstrate some level of skill. If I were to go back and do it over again I would try to avoid the trap of only answering the questions that were asked and instead I'd pick a problem that I suspect they encounter and ask how they addressed or solved it. Hopefully this will be the impetus to demonstrate some technical ability.

I applied online and got called up by an HR woman not long after. I had to do a few phone interviews and they all went very well. I'm very experienced in what I do and it was soon made clear by my interviewers that they were very impressed and wanted me to get me on board asap. I had to go to their office in SF for a last live interview. The guy that had to interview me was arrogant, didn't listen to me and clearly didn't want to invest too much time or effort. I got the impression I wasn't 'cool' enough and the interview was over before I knew it. Soon after I got an email that I wouldn't get hired. I am really insulted by their way of hiring people. Never before have I seen such unprofessionalism. I guess some people at Dropbox are just too young to be making decisions and some people are in the wrong place. Tip: know your stuff and THEN be extravagant, get noticed, "develop your cool" before you go. Jeans and blue shirt is too common to get accepted. Or don't bother at all. They're obviously looking for someone special.

It was a telephone interview lasting an hour. The questions was mainly on algorithm, and was basically easy to answer. The interviewer was nice, but kind of tired, guess it's because I'm interviewing in early Saturday morning. At last I didn't get the intern, but it was all my fault. My English is kind of poor.

Applied through their jobs website, and a recruiter reached out to me to sit an online coding test on HackerRank - had 5 days to complete it. After passing that, I had two phone interviews, but didn't make it past the second one. Had very good communication from the recruiters all the way along, and they were very efficient.

Implement a function that searches a file system for files with identical contents.   Answer Question

A friend (who had interviewed with Dropbox previously, but no offer) introduced me to the recruiter via email. The recruiter responded about two weeks later and sent me a HackerRank coding question. I didn't think it would be very difficult, since I've completed HackerRank coding questions previously for other companies with ease. Oh, how very naive I was. The question was very difficult (for me at least). It was a pattern matching question which seemed like I was supposed to code up a lexical analyzer in an hour... Based on what I've read on Glassdoor, other candidates went straight to either HR screening interviews or technical interviews. I believe I was given an exceptionally hard coding challenge question so that the recruiter could say they gave me a chance but they weren't going to bother with me unless I was extremely smart. It was really just a courtesy coding challenge an they had already decided to reject me. Seeing as how I was recommended by a previously rejected candidate, I suppose I should seen their veiled rejection coming (in the form of a coding challenge). I'm really disappointed at the Dropbox recruiting practice. I've worked at Microsoft before and interviewed at Google, Facebook, Square, Twitter, Airbnb, Pinterest, etc., and I've never had this sort of treatment.

Question was "Given a pattern and a string input - find if the string follows the same pattern and return 0 or 1. Examples: 1) Pattern : "abba", input: "redblueredblue" should return 1. 2) Pattern: "aaaa", input: "asdasdasdasd" should return 1. 3) Pattern: "aabb", input: "xyzabcxzyabc" should return 0. I saw someone else had a similar question, but it was much much easier as the other candidate was given spaces between words to help identify individual words to pattern match.   7 Answers

I got an initial phone call, and two phone interviews. The engineers are very friendly, they spend 20 minutes discussing with you before asking the question. However when you apply they want things to go very fast (so when they call you, they'd like you to have an interview within a week or maximum 2).

You have a number of meetings (with their start and end times). You need to schedule them using the minimum number of rooms. Return the list of meetings in every room.   1 Answer Design an LRU cache. It's a data struct with a capacity. Beyond this capacity the least recently used item is removed. You should be able to insert an element, access an element given its key, and delete an element, in constant time. Note that when you access an element, even if it's just for a read, it becomes the most recently used.   3 Answers

The recruiter called and helped set up a technical interview over the phone. The question is actually easy and a CS student will learn that in their first year in college. However, because it is very easy and very fundamental, any error you made will be fatal, and that is exactly why I failed.

The interview was an hour long and two employees watched over me. The whole process felt awkward and poorly prepared. First the interviewers were about 20 minutes late to the interview, and I found it difficult to build a rapport with either interviewer. They did not spend anytime with pleasantries or looking over my resume they dove straight into a skills test.

given a number as a string write a algorithm to map to its oral description. I.e. "1" -&gt; "11" //this can be thought of as there is one one. "11" -&gt; "21" // there are two ones "21" -&gt; "1211" // there is one two and one one "1211" -&gt; "111221" ect. //there is one one, one two and two ones   6 Answers given the output from the first question write a algorithm to calculate how many possible inputs could have created that output. for example. "1211" could be interpreted as one two and one one || one hundred and twenty one ones.   6 Answers The final question was now given your algorithms compute the complexity of them.   2 Answers
