Applied online for a few positions. Didn't hear back for 3 weeks, then received an email from recruiter telling that there will be a hiring event and I should apply for another position for a cloud team (the position wasn't exactly for my profile to be frank) and register for event. I did that, and received a link for online tech screen. Recruiter was supposed to have a chat with me before that, but he never called on the scheduled time, and didn't even bother to follow up. So I took the test without instructions, it was pretty easy one, I was able to finish in half time. Then I sent email to recruiter asking if he can follow up and he said that his calendar was broken (that's weird, Microsoft can't provide reliable calendars, was it Outlook calendar). Then I received the automated reply saying that I didn't pass the tech screen which is just weird. It's the last time I'm dealing with microsoft. Better spend more time and prepare for Google, at least they are professional and organized and treat candidates with respect.

I send my resume to Microsoft on school career fair, and received email 3 weeks later. And the interview was held on campus. I was first asked one behaviour question then a question about binary tree. I spent some time finding the idea to solve the problem and then asked to write code on a blank sheet.

First question is: What is the biggest technical challenge you have met in your internship/projects? Second question is: Given a node of a binary tree, find the next node of the in order traversal of the tree.   1 Answer

I had an interview on campus in Fall 2014 for an internship, but they emailed me back and told me that while the interview went well, they didn't have any positions available at the time. I thought it was just a really nice way of saying "thanks, but no thanks." Fast forward to Fall 2015, when my recruiter emailed me and asked me if I would like to go to Redmond for interviews since the on campus interview went well last year. I went, and I must say that I was very impressed with Microsoft. They drove us potential University Recruits to their campus in a Limo! The interview process was four 45-minute interviews in a row, with a 15 minute break between each one. I was surprised that I was being interviewed for a group that did higher level programming even though I have studied more low-level programming in recent years because I'm a Computer Engineering student. I think some of the other interviewees who were looking for higher level jobs were confused too, because they interviewed most of them for the operating systems track. I'm not sure if there was a mix-up or not! The interviews themselves were very engaging and the interviewers presented challenging questions. I strongly suspect that one of the people who was interviewing me was texting while I had my back turned and was talking through a problem on the whiteboard, but the rest of it went pretty well. I didn't get an offer, but I'm glad I went.

Referral/School career fair, then phone screen, then an onsite. You're either applying for a software engineering role or a program manager (PM, pretty much product managing) role, though often times they don't really take your preferences into account. The onsite consists of 3 - 5 interviews (it oddly varied depending on the person, not sure why that is).

A recruiter read off a list of questions from a sheet of paper and recorded them down. Questions were things like: - Tell me a time when you worked on a team, what role did you play - Tell me a time when you faced a technical difficulty - How many lines of code was your biggest project - Tell me about a project you&#039;ve worked on - Do you like problem solving?   1 Answer

I was contacted by a Microsoft recruiter (who by the way gave me one of the worst customer experiences. The response time for each email was minimum of 3 days! ) who found a team for me to interview. I did not know that there was a Microsoft policy (and I was educated of this via my recruiter), that Microsoft does not schedule an interview more than 14 days in advance. So 14 days before I actually wanted to schedule an interview I contacted the recruiter. After being assured that my interview was scheduled, I applied for brief break from work. The interview did not happen when I had taken a leave of absense (so time off wasted!). I feel getting a good recruiter to work with is an important thing with Microsoft. There was a 45 min phone screen. There were 5 onsite interviews. 4 techincal and 1 hiring manager. I did not get an offer because the hiring manager said I had a lot of UI experience and the team had another candidate who had more backend experience. The hiring manager requested the recruiter to help me find another position but I did not pursue as the recruiter was a pain to work with.

The questions are very standard but covers almost all data structures and algorithms. Still they are much easier than the ones i got from Google. Overall the interviewers are very nice and helpful. They made the interviews seem like a work place discussion rather than tests so i was very relaxed and confidently talked my way through it. Got an offer within a week.

Other than that it was a pretty easy technical question, and a few behavioral question. The on site interview in their headquarter was very organized, however my last interviewer told me "I know people can't think when interviewers stare at them, so I am gonna check my emails for a while while you code on the board, no need to talk through every line of code to me." which I found odd. And that was the interview I failed. The questions were all pretty standard, harder than the on campus one but still very manageable.

There were two stages: rounds 1 and 2. The first round is done on the university campus, where they get to know you and assess your skills. I applied after a coding competition held on campus. This interview involved one technical question and some questions about my history. The interviewer simply wanted me to gush about who I am and what I'm proud of. Round 2 was a very different experience. This round they bring you to the Redmond campus for a set of interviews, I was flown out from Ottawa. There will be 3-5 interviews, depending on constraints. The interviewers all ask at least 1 technical question, and generally these questions cover your entire skillset. It's difficult if you're nervous, but if you go in with a good mood and no expectations you can get through fine.

I went through the college recruiting process. Microsoft was among the companies that set up stations at our computer science major recruiting fair where I signed up. The first round was on campus: lasted about 40 minutes, and was easy for a computer science major. About a week later, a recruiter emailed me to tell me that I was being invited for on-site interviews in Redmond (Seattle), WA. The recruiters are extremely fast and helpful in communicating; interestingly, Microsoft's recruiting process outdoes other companies (Google, FB etc) completely in efficiency and generosity. You're flown out to Redmond and stay in a really comfy hotel with a generous spending budget. Now, it's good to know how on-site interviews work: you begin your day early by meeting with your recruiter, who you should befriend since they are "on your side", so to speak, and their input can matter in the decision process. Then, you have consecutive technical interviews lasting about an hour each. You don't have to do perfectly in all of them, but I had a very strong feeling that the first 2 are the most important. The first one is particularly important. If you are doing well, you will get a 4th and sometimes 5th technical interview. If you're lucky, you will afterwards get a final interview with a manager of sometimes, like in my case, a really impressive big boss type person. This big boss can basically hire you on the spot, and its pretty cool that you get to meet someone like this. Don't forget that for Microsoft, as well as other companies, several things matter for college recruiting; your interviews, first and foremost, but also your coursework, projects, grades, internship experiences, etc. Also, knowing more math than average CS majors helps. The next day I found out that I was getting an offer, and the next business day after that my recruiter called me with the details over the phone. Microsoft really, really wants smart new grads. The company and culture has REALLY been improving the past few years, and they want smart new grads to keep that up. Offers are actually more generous than at other competing companies. In my case, you might really like the people you meet or have a personal connection with the big boss type person at the end, in which case your offer could potentially be for the team you actually interviewed with. In this case, you have a choice whether you want to be with that team or go back in the general "hired" pool which is distributed into teams at some later point.

All expense paid trip to Redmond. Flew me in, stayed 3 days 2 nights in a sweet hotel, rental car, fancy meals, the works. The on site interview was with 4 engineers from the same team. 45 minute interviews with each one. Most of them were simple conversations. If you make it to this round it's basically a culture fit. They didn't ask a single code question and none of those stupid "How many golf balls fit in a school bus" type questions. The whole team was really good. Less than a week later the recruiter contacted me with an offer. They're looking for people that love what they do and love to learn and grow on their own.

First round of phone screening was mainly talking about my background. I think the interviewer was from HR/Recruiting so was not very technical. You need to sell yourself in this round. I had a nice project in parallel computing which I focused on and I believe that is what help me secure an on-site. I was also asked a common puzzle- 3 baskets with oranges, apples and mixed. Labels on the baskets are jumbled. Find the correct baskets in one attempt by picking a fruit from any basket Advice: Impress your interviewer by marketing your skills well and back it up with the work you have done. I was flown in to Seattle and based in a Redmond hotel a night before my on-site interview. On the day of the interview a Microsoft cab picks you up from the airport and takes you to their Recruiting building. There were many other candidates, but they were mainly for internships. You meet with your designated recruiter who is your point of contact post-interview. As mentioned in other reviews, talk nicely with this recruiter and highlight your skill and more importantly your passion for Microsoft. This recruiter has a say in your final yes or no decision. Had 5 interviews on-site with 5 senior engineers/managers. Each interviewers experience at Microsoft progresivelly increased- ranging from 10 years to 25 years. Each interview is for 1 hour, in which the interviewer will talk about his role/experience for 10-15 minutes, ask about your experience for 10-15 minutes and the rest would be a coding question. These interviews were not exceptionally difficult. I felt and had heard that more than cracking every coding questions, at Microsoft, it is more about 1. Being very passionate and excited to join Microsoft 2. Writing clean quality code with comments, main driver function, corner cases, talking as you write and testing the code 3. Presenting yourself professionally. You have the write background if you ve made it on-site. Focus on that background, while continually showing your excitment about being there and wanting to join Microsoft. Have a solid answer to "Why Microsoft?" Ask them smart questions which show your thinking ability. Before starting to code on whiteboard, ask clarifying questions about the problem, talk about your design to the problem, point out any limitations. Start coding with proper comments, spaces, use good variable/functions names etc. You will hear back from the recruiter in 1-3 days. Microsoft gives a generous offer, with bonuses and RSUs, benifits, however, if you have a competing offer do negotiate. You will surely get a higher package.

The onsite interview started at 8am. They had a hotel at the shuttle to pick a group of us up at 7. You will be interviewing for the same position with a group of other people, though the actual interview portions are 1 on 1. It's 4 interviews and then lunch. They questions alternated between the interviewer seeming to think I was completely incompetent basic programming questions and normal fairly difficult technical interview questions. There is a good amount of emphasis on your past experience, and a decent amount of the harder problems only required pseudocode. It is 8am, and there are only minimal breaks between interviews, during which you sit in the lobby chatting with your fellow interviewees/competition.

The process started at my university career fair where I gave out a resume. They gave me a t-shirt They got in touch a week later to schedule an on-campus interview at the university career services building. The interviewer asked one general thinking question (not coding) and one coding question. They also asked about my resume and research. Three or four weeks later I was contacted by an interview scheduler to setup an interview in Redmond. Due to the holiday season, I wasn't able to schedule the interview until a month later in January. The scheduler was not my recruiter and just was setting up the travel and timing. They flew me up and back and put me up in a hotel for 2 nights / 3 days. On their campus I first met with my recruiter in their recruiting building number 111. They informed me of which team I was interviewing with and stated that I should expect 4-5 hour long interviews (with one extended to 90 minutes to include lunch). In the recruiting building, while waiting to meet with a recruiter, you can play Xbox games, try out Windows Mobile products, and speak with a concierge who can help with sightseeing in Seattle or nightlight or transportation. The interviews were each with someone from a different sub-team inside the group I interviewed with. Each person had me do a coding question, and some also asked algorithmic or conceptual questions (which didn't require explicit coding). Everything was on the whiteboard. I had 5 total interviews, and had time in 4 of them to ask questions of the interviewer about their team. After the interviews I met with the recruiter again, and explained that I had immediate deadlines. They agreed to get in contact with the team and get back to me while I hung out in the lobby and relaxed. They came back and informed me that the team was very interested and would be making an offer. The offer arrived the next day, with fairly standard compensation and bonus/stock. I ended up declining the offer.

My interview began at 9am at the Microsoft NERD Center in Cambridge, MA. I had three interviews scheduled before the lunch break and three interviews after. All the interviews were standard - straightforward whiteboard coding or brainteasers. Many of my interviews ran over time (one ran 45 mins over). I ended up not having time for lunch at all - my previous interview had run over and only half an hour of time had been scheduled, so I had 15 mins to purchase lunch in the lobby and run back upstairs to make the next interview. I would advise other candidates to bring their own lunches - the cafe was extremely crowded and it took me the entire 15 mins to get food and pay. I didn't have a complete schedule for the day, so I was unable to give the name of my next interviewer to the receptionist and ended up waiting in the lobby until my interviewer eventually came out to investigate. Since my interviews had run over time, my day was extended by an hour and I did the final coding interview after my meeting with the hiring manager (which was supposed to be the end of the day). I would encourage other candidates to brush up on their basic coding skills (string manipulation etc.) and brainteasers - the interviews were not design heavy. I would also encourage candidates to get a copy of their schedules in advance in case things go awry as security is very tight in the building. If I were to interview again, I would also bring snacks just in case.

Phone call after applying. Quick behavioral questions. Final question about 9 marbles, 1 heavier than all of them, find it using a 2 plate scale. Get an email inviting me to fly out a month later. They set you up with a nice hotel in Bellvue, WA and a rental car (if chosen). Pay for all your meals - an allowance of $75 a day or something in that area. Day of the interview comes, they pick candidates up together in a party bus infront of the hotel. The bus had flashing strobe lights and neon green lighting at 7am in the morning. It was funny if anything, but quite silly. Throughout the whole thing, I never get told what I was interviewing for. They finally told us and I was COMPLETELY uninterested in the team. That spiked my confidence down. I could've saved MS $2,000+ for my trip if they told me that upfront, I would've declined. Even after talking to all the interviewers, it clearly wasn't for me. So how they got that from my resume I'm not sure. But, that doesn't mean I didn't give it my best shot. Four 45 minute interviews with 5 minute breaks in between for food/drink. The atmosphere was wonderful. It was a great confidence booster. I felt awesome and confident I could nail the position anyway, and after the first interviewer I was told that mobility was a nice perk of the job without even asking! The interviewers started with questions about me, my past projects, strengths/weaknesses, technical questions next, and left maybe a minute or two for questions about them. Technical questions were: -Implement circular array with a k-step elimination -Return sub-array with a maximum continuous sum -Check for a tic-tac-toe winner given a matrix -Without knowing the size of an array, find an element. Strongest interview I think I've ever had. Yet I was told 2 work-days after leaving that they passed on me. I think I fell short on the last interview, with the element in the array, because I didn't realize try-catch was an option to use in a interview. My previous work experience does NOT use try-catch loops, that's a big no-no, they're super slow. I've always used assertions. I got halfway through the question before that and he was unhelpful in pointing out options to solve the problem. He was also a very off-putting interviewer, and didn't seem organized. The other 3 interviewers I had - we laughed, we discussed interesting topics like AI/machine-learning, I nailed the technical questions from start to finish with room for testing and optimization, it was a great time. So my best guess is that last guy talked bad of me, and I was told you need all 4 to basically love you to get in. Waste of time, waste of money on their part. Summary - super easy interviews with laid back atmosphere, great hospitality, but you're left in the dark with what you're interviewing for until the day of and all it takes is 1 interviewer to be stubborn and unreasonable.

How would you find the head of the cycle i.e. where the cycle starts? How would you find the kth element from the end of a linked list? Then about 2 weeks later I got an invitation for interviews on-site and about 3 weeks after that I flew out to Redmond. I had 4 interviews on-site which had behavioral questions and also coding questions like: How would you test a phone (your simple 20 year old phone)?

I applied through university career fair in mid-September and got the first-round interview in late-October. The interviewer asked me two questions. Both of them are not hard and I have seen both of them before. The first one is maximum subset sum and the second one is to write a program to transpose a matrix. I answered them correctly and quickly. The interviewer then asked me if I have seen similar problems before because he thought I answered them "Too quickly and correctly". I didn't want to lie to him so I told the truth that I really saw them before. He said nothing. A few days later, I received an email saying I performed excellently in the interview but the quota of internship for my university is full.

I first applied through college job fair then was interviewed on campus couple weeks later where I was asked two questions one about writing an algorithm to count the height of a binary tree and the other about making an algorithm that spits out the binary of a given number. Then I was interviewed in Redmond about a month later where I was interviewed by four different people each one asked me a technical questions that wasn't that bad. Read the next section for the questions.

Four technical questions: 1) Given an MxM array make it rotate in a certain way. The rotation was a little complicated and I couldn't answer this question very well. The interviewer did not do a very good job explaining it.   Answer Question 2) Write a new version of strcpy where it will return the null terminator no matter what. Did a better job on this one the guy said he was evaluating for correctness not only for idea.   Answer Question 3) Given a string with many words make a function that would reverse all of the letters in every word. For this one I first wrote a crappy algorithm that takes O(n^2) but then I did a better one that worked in linear time.   Answer Question 4) This guy was more complicated he first asked me different questions about object oriented programming. I did not know what a virtual class was. He then asked me to do some string manipulation and kept making the problem harder until we ran out of time. The problem he started off with was write an algorithm that counts how many repeated letters are in a string and kept going from there. -- There was very few behavioral questions about my favorite projects.   Answer Question

The onsite interview was amazing, you first get there and sit in the main lobby for about an hour. Here they want you to play with some of the stuff such as playing video games on their xbox one. They give you free coffee and drinks while you wait. They do this to help your relax. After this you talk to a recruiter for a while and he explains what team you'll be interviewing for and how each interview will happen. The interviews were pretty nice, they were semi-difficult questions. Most of them were based on strings with a couple of graph theory questions. Some of the questions are based on your resume experience. If you get walked out after lunch the process is over, at the last interview you'll talk to your future potential manager.

Was contacted by phone and email 2 months after applying online and through campus recruiting. Phone interview consisted of fairly basic data structure questions involving stacks/queues and things like bucket sort. I was surprised by how tailored to my resume all of the other questions were, though. So make sure that you know everything you put on your resume well enough to speak strongly about. I made this mistake but it was apparently minor enough since I got invited for onsite interviews. Flew out to Seattle within 2 weeks of my phone interview. We stayed in the commons and hung out with a large (>40) group of other applicants for various positions--mostly SDE intern. It was pretty neat as we got to ride a party bus to the campus. The waiting room for all the interns was very nice. Large touchscreen TV for fruit ninja, another large surface table for other minigames, catered snacks and drinks. I was an afternoon interviewee so we went to lunch first. The Microsoft lunch area is very nice. We got a $10 voucher for any restaurant type establishment. Everything had a bit of an upscale mall food court feel in a good way. Drinks were also free for all employees, which is cool. I was interviewing for a position in MSIT, which is Microsoft's internal tooling software teams. Things like the enterprise e-commerce division and others. Three technical interviews which were equal parts conversational and coding and one completely conversational job fit. Again my resume topics were discussed quite a bit more than I expected. My interviewers were very interested in projects that I had worked on in groups and broad design choices we had made, so if you have any, be ready to speak to them. The interviews went well enough, though I think I choked in the last technical interview. They gradually make your solutions more and more difficult by adding restrictions like runtime and allowed data structures. It got to a point where I simply didn't have an answer, but that might be what they're looking for. 2 business days later, I got a call with an offer from my recruiter for an SDE position. A slightly lower base salary from the average, but I suspect they're including at least part of the -very- generous benefits package that Microsoft provides.

Lots of string manipulation and conceptual OOP questions. Wasn't expecting that based on the frequency of graph/tree questions that I felt was more the norm from other internship interview reviews.   Answer Question

I am a mechanical engineer by training with past programming experience for primarily personal projects (video games and such) in multiple languages. I'm currently in a PhD program finishing up the masters portion. I casually chatted with a recruiter at a university career fair who told me that he will pass on my resume and that there "may" be something for me at Microsoft but he doesn't know what. He told me to contact the university recruiter in a few days and she might be able to help me better. They called me for a screening interview for an internship the day after. I'm not - what I like to call - "classically trained" when it comes to computer science. I prepared for the screening interview by going through the MIT OCW Algorithms and Data Structures course and also reading Miller and Ranum's "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures." The screening interview went better than expected. Among other things, I was asked to design a parking lot and write code for detecting palindromes. A few weeks later I got a call for a final round interview. It took a while for them to schedule an interview and they gave me a date which was 3 days after a major deadline with my sponsor and so I requested a later date. The scheduler worked with my availability and got me a date that worked. They flew me to Redmond for an interview with the Bing team (I wasn't given that information until the morning of the interview). I was supposed to get 3 to 5 interviews. My first interviewer was late because he missed an email sent by the receptionist. Everything after that went smoothly. I got through all 5 interviews. The third interview was over lunch (we wrote code after, not during). The fifth interview was with a program manager. The questions seemed relatively easy. The topics were: queue design, common ancestor search in a tree with no underlying structure, mixed uni and multi byte character strings, detection of unique addresses, and linked list scanning and element removal. Some interviewers wanted me to just solve a problem as well as I could. Others were looking for a discussion of the problem (one of which was actually very interesting and have the interviewer some new ideas). At the very end I asked the hiring manager some subtle questions about my performance and what kind of competition I was facing. It's nice to be told that there is a "high probability" of them making an offer :)

Suppose you have a string which has characters that are either one or two bytes long. A one byte character has 0 as the left most bit. The first byte of a two byte character has 1 as the left most bit but the second byte's left most bit (LMB) could be either 1 or 0. Implement an algorithm for removing 1 character from the end of the string. How would you do it while scanning backwards from the end of the string. Followup: What if you needed to do this repeatedly? Is there some way you could reduce the time complexity to constant?   1 Answer

They booked flight and hotel for me. Bring my passport and electronic plane ticket, I started my interview journey. On-site interview was in an afternoon. There was four round one-to-one interviews, three for coding problems, one for design problems. About twenty candidates took the interview on that day.

Applied through campus job fair, heard back in around 2 months for an on-campus interview. The interview was supposed to be 30 minutes long, however mine ran around 20 minutes overtime.

Submitted my resume both online and to the college recruiter, and had an initial on-campus interview one month later. The interview is only 30 minutes long. The interviewer first asked about my resume and we had time for only one technical question. I gave a search algorithm and he asked me to improve the runtime. Finally he let me ask him questions about the job.

Given a method that takes in a string of letters and returns if it is a valid word, how do you solve the problem of word segmentation? In other words, given a string of letters (a-z only) and return a valid break down of the string into an array of words.

However, 3 weeks after on-campus interview, I received an invitation to the final-round on-site interview at Redmond. At on-site interview date, there would be 3~5 interviews. Since I had an offer about to due, I told my recruiter to notify me the decision as soon as possible. At the end of the date, my recruiter told me that all the feedback were positive except for the last one which was not available yet. She promised me she would respond by early next week.

This is for a SDE internship. My relationship with Microsoft began when a friend of mine invited me to a dinner with some Microsoft employees who were visiting my university's campus. I later spoke with them and gave them my resume at my school's career fair, and was offered an on-site interview. It lasted thirty minutes and was very enjoyable; I was asked to do a string operation and design a certain object from an OOP perspective. Easy enough, and I had a lot of fun talking with the interviewer about Microsoft and my projects/interests. A few weeks later, I got an invitation to fly out to Redmond to interview on-site for the Operating Systems Group. Microsoft paid for all of my expenses, and I stayed in the very pleasant Marriott Hotel. I arrived on campus at about 8:30 AM and my first interview was at 10. I spoke with the other interns and some of the staff before my first interview, all were friendly. I had a total of four interviews, one of which was over lunch (the food at their cafeterias is excellent, by the way). All were a lot of fun, and my interviewers chose good questions - ones that could be looked at in many ways, answered in many ways, and expanded on. This made our discussions very interesting. I was extremely tired by the fourth interview, as I had only just arrived at my hotel at midnight the previous night. I got back to the hotel at around 3, and took a nap. My flight didn't leave till close to midnight, so it was a long night getting home... But worth it - I received an offer a week later.

I applied online in August and got an phone interview. We talked about my past experience and I was given a simple brain teaser and a design question. Mostly focused on my work/project experience. Waited 4~5 weeks and then they told me they want to fly me out to Redmond to do onsite interviews. Travel + hotel all booked by their travel team. I was attending a conference in a different city the week before my interview but it was no problem for them to adjust my flight for my convenience. Everything was really nice, they do really take care of their employees and potential ones as well. On the interview day, I woke up around 6 and went out to the lobby of the hotel around 6:45 am , there were other people who are also waiting to get picked up by Microsoft. We arrived at the building where interviews are held. Breakfast at 7:30, mingle with other interviewees, and then interview started at 8. Each 45 minutes long with 15 min breaks in between. Lunch at noon, we all headed to the "Commons" (or whatever they call it) it's the main area of the campus. Where we ate was giant food court style, all sorts of food available. etc. After lunch, we headed back to the interview building and they told us some logistics of what's next. 1.5 days later, I got an email asking when I'll be available to "chat" and the next day, my recruiter called and said I got the position. One thing I want to say is that, Redmond + Bellevue is dominated by Microsoft buildings and it seems that you get a lot of respect if you are an Microsoft employee. They even have a "Microsoft employee only" counter at the Seattle airport. Blew my mind...

This is a the first round on campus interview. I was selected as one of the 12 interviewees that gets the opportunity. The recruiter comes from HQ in Seattle, and he joked that he still feel the jet leg. The recruiter is a serious guy but very professional in recruiting. I like the way he goes straight into point and asks me about my background, the language that I am comfortable with - C++, Java. The first technique question is about the similarity and difference between C++ and Java. Then he asks me to calculate the factorial of an array of integers. I think I did not that bad on this one, because everybody knows how to calculate the factorial of an integer. After finishing with the code, he wants me to tell him the pro and cons that I choose this recursion algorithm. I talked about he efficiency of writing and understanding in the format of recursion, and the con is algorithm complexity. He then asked me how to improve the algorithm, I did not come up with a good alternative algorithm, so I told him I can implement the recursion in a distributed fashion. The pro is scalability, and the con is extra cost on machines. At last, he ask me to say something about testing - how to possibly test the class I just wrote. I think I did well in this one - you just need to say how you generate the input and how to compare the experimental output to the known output.

Meet with a recruiter at a campus career fair and scheduled an on-campus screen two days later. This was followed up within less than a week for final-round interviews at a regional interviewing event. The process was quick. The interviewers were flown in to a regional office instead of flying us out to Seattle; I believe this was because I've already visited their offices earlier in the year. So instead of meeting each interviewer in their office, all the interviewees were based in the same room with the recruiter while the interviewers came in to get each of us for a 1:1 in a private room.

The process was extremely well organized, requiring minimal effort for the interviewee. Flights were arranged as well as land travel to get to the hotel and interview location in Washington. For the actual interviews, four one-on-one interviews were held very early in the morning, since they needed to fit in two sessions in one day. My session went from 8am to 12pm, while the second session went from 1pm to 5pm. Each interview was a pretty standard technical interview that lasted 50 minutes. Questions were very technical and heavy on algorithms, but nothing out of the ordinary for software engineering interviews. The recruiters were very consistent in making you feel comfortable and answering any questions in between the interviews. They were clear and accurate about when results would be given for how the interviews went, which in my case was just two days.

I had an interview a few weeks later with a PM from the Mountain View campus. She recommended me for a SDE internship, and about 2 weeks after that interview I was notified that I would be flown to Redmond for final rounds. They changed the location to Mountain View, CA a few weeks later. I flew over, stayed over two nights, and on the second day, had my interview. There were four rounds, based in C++ (my most familiar language was Java). The last round was with a high-up manager who talked about Microsoft's goals and future direction. I heard less than 24 hours after my last interview through email that I got a position as a summer intern.

Overall I felt like I had a tough interview question and a tough/apathetic interviewer. He started checking his phone once I started writing on the whiteboard and clearly seemed more focused on getting the interviews done on time so he wouldn't be late for the next ones.

Questions on Data structures, algorithms, coding etc. some puzzles also. More than the solution the approach to solving a problem is important and talking your solution through convincingly. Answers to coding questions must have test cases, exception handling, readable code with comments, and also be able to satisfy most input sets.

I submit my resume in Microsoft campus recruiting and was invited for an interview. The interview lasts for 30 minutes and starts with some questions about my background. After that, the interviewer gave a coding problem which was quite simple. I was a little nervous since this was the first interview in my life. I solved the problem and wrote the code in C++ in 20 minutes. Normally, this kind of problem should not take more than ten minutes for me. I waited for a week and didn't hear anything back.

I applied the Software Development Engineer Intern 2015 Summer in our University Career Site before the recruiters came to our school on the career fair. After about one month, I got email from their recruiter saying that they would like to set up an in-person interview at school. I selected the best time fit me. There are three sections in the first round interview. The first is talking about myself and my projects listed on my resume. Then I had a coding problem about basic algorithm on paper. The last section is asking questions about Microsoft. The interview process was pretty standard, and the whole interview last about 45 minutes.

The most difficult question, I would say, was the explanation of one technology that I listed on my resume, but I was not well-prepared for.   1 Answer

I tried to explain the mix-up to my interviewer, who didn't seem to understand or acknowledge my questions and just plowed ahead. It was a really awkward and uncomfortable experience.

The recruiter had a quick chat with me before arranging for a technical interview for evaluating my problem solving/algorithms/programming skills. The technical interview was conducted over phone and collabedit. I was given a programming problem (to be solved in the language of my choice). I used JavaScript to write the solution. The interviewer pointed out the need for optimization and gave some hints. I quickly figured out a fairly optimized code. The interviewer didn't sound too impressed with my performance. As the problem was fairly simple, he probably expected me to write a perfectly optimized code on the first shot. In my opinion, I exhibited the ability to discuss and think through solutions, rather than being well-versed in solving a certain class of problems. There is no telling what works.

Nothing unexpected or particularly difficult. What is really hard is that the transparency is one way. You give your answers and you will never get to know what the interviewer was expecting to hear.   Answer Question

This was a technical interview that I met with the person in his office. He was nice, greeted me and asked a few questions about what I did in my previous jobs. While solving the problem, he helped me with some small hints or questions. I felt more like brainstorming with a work friend rather than being interviewed, which was nice. In the end he thanked and told he is going to let the lead know and they are going to follow up with me with details.

I attended a conference and noted down the presenter's email id as I was really impressed with the work they were doing. When looking for full time, I contacted the person for any openings in their team. Fortunately, I heard back from them and got a phone screen schedule within one week. Phone Screen was easy and mainly focused on the projects i wrote in my resume and some algorithmic problems related with those projects. Within one week, I heard back from them that I was through first round and need to come to Seattle for face to face interview. They were really helpful in scheduling the interview according to my convenience. Microsoft takes care of their their employees and potential employees as well in my case. Wonderful and systematic scheduling. I landed in Seattle. Whole day was set aside for interviews, I had 5 in total including the famous 5th interview which is a positive sign as mentioned by many here. First interview, little variation on the level order traversal which i was able to code it with some help from the recruiter who was really nice. You will have to write the code on board so I would suggest do some "Actual" coding preferably on some IDE which shows only syntactical errors and runs the program. Eclipse is sometimes too helpful which let's us forget minor mistakes. Second round was a real life project problem related with quick ip lookup, for which I have default solution, Tries. I told each and every pros and cons of using tries and the interviewer was satisfied. I stumbled a little while implementing it but eventually was able to do that with of course the help of interviewer. Oh yeah one more thing each interview is approximately 45 mins to 60 mins long and lunch time discussion is also part of the recruiting process. So don't lose your head thinking that it's not part of the process. 3rd interview which included the lunch discussion as i mentioned above. I was not aware of it but since interviewer only discussed my projects on resume, i was happy to talk about them. But was really thinking why the lunch is so much work. Later i realised when interviewer said, let's go back to the office and continue the discussion. This was the toughest round as interviewer went in to very specific details about my projects so one tip do remember some of the tools names, just to name drop them ;) 4th round was a short one as the 3rd one went for one and half hours. This one was comparatively lighter and mainly focused on design problems. Then came, the nerve wrecking wait as they told me to wait so that they all can discuss how i performed and decide on the last interview with the 2nd line manager. Thankfully manager came soon and ask me to wait for 2nd line manager. That discussion was very informal sort as he was selling me Microsoft and why I should come and work there. Happy sign always ! :) Then I came back to my awesome hotel as I had my flight back same day in the evening. Almost next day itself the HR contacted me and I missed her call. I really thought I did'nt get through but thankfully Hr called me back next day and told me I am through !! Only advice I can give you is "CODE" ! there is no way around it! If you want to work as SDE you need to know Algorithms and Data Structures ! Language is no issue but you must know how to implement it. At least able to discuss why to us and why not to use a particular data structure.

I wen through the full interview process, from recruiter screen up to the full day in person interviews in Bellevue (the position was for the Dynamics AX platform). My initial technical screen was pretty standard, the question was determining if two strings were anagrams of each other. Aside from this I was able to speak with the senior engineer who was interviewing my about the position and some pro's and con's which was really great. He provided some good insight for me. After the technical screen I was invited in for full day of interviews in Bellevue. I flew out to Seattle and stayed for 2 nights. The entire travel process was great, they covered everything and put me up in a nice hotel. The interview day was long, I had a series of interviews each testing different areas. All of the interviews were with senior engineers with 5 - 20 years experience. The first interview covered SQL, I was given a schema and asked to point out any issues/improvements and then write some queries. The next 2 covered CS based questions like algorithms, runtime analysis .. etc. Next I had a lunch interview where I was able to talk with another engineer about his role and get a little more of a sense of the day to day life. Finally I had one more algorithms based interview and that was the end. Overall I found that the interview process was very well done and the hr staff at Microsoft were really easy to deal with. When it comes to the atmosphere at Microsoft it has a really corporate feel to it and truthfully it was not my top choice having been there but that's more of a personal preference.

After the phone interview, they sent me an email saying I got past the phone round and they wanted me to go to Redmond, but they had no positions available anymore, so I could try again next year and bypass the phone round.

Applied online and after a month or so heard back and was invited to attend a back to back interview on campus, one with a recruiter, one with an engineer. Both were really pleasant, the engineering interview was a simple programming task done on a laptop: write a function which given a string will return if it contains correctly matched open and closed parentheses. Expanded to include other types of brackets and return if all were correctly matched. I heard back very quickly informing me I had made it through to the final round on site assessment day. Couldn't make the first couple of interview dates offered so was eventually invited to travel to Redmond for an interview day at the main offices. Organizing travel was very easy and everyone involved was incredibly helpful. On the day, arrived at building 111 for mid morning. Was guided around campus and taken to the commons for a free lunch. We visited the visitors center and the company store and were invited to buy up to $120 of discount merch. We then returned to 111 for the interviews. We were each allocated a division we'd be interviewing for (this was not shared before the first interview). We were each interviewed by four interviewers who asked a variety of question covering fundamentals of computer science and some advanced material. We had a ten minute gap between each interview in which the examiners compared notes before we were launched into the next one. Asked technical questions on a number of topics, sorting algorithms and their time and space complexities, binary trees and binary search trees, low level computer scheduling and atomicity of operations, and an abstract data type question. I've provided examples of a small number of questions below. These were mixed in among other behavioral questions, attitudes, what do you do for fun, what's important when implementing software, how to interact with team members etc. It was generally very broad with lots of interesting questions; I wouldn't say especially hard but thats all relative... If you know the field and are well prepared you shouldn't find anything too tough... Don't worry about making mistakes, I know I sure made a couple, the key is checking back over your solutions as you go, work with test cases and when you identify a shortcoming, work out how you can fix it. TALK OUT LOUD! They don't care if you get stuck in a circle as long as they can see your thought process and why it's happening. If you've overlooked something they will happily drop a hint and see if you can rectify. My biggest tip would be friendly and relaxed, make it more of a conversation than a rigid interview. I almost got the feeling they were more interested in my personality than what I wrote on the board, so make it easy for them to like you: At the end of the day the big question they're asking themselves is, 'would I like to work alongside this person', not just 'can he do the work'. Overall, my interview was incredibly positive, everyone was super friendly and did their best to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. The company was very generous with arranging travel, accommodation etc and first and foremost Microsoft seemed an incredible place to work. Go for it, give it your best shot, what is there to lose?

After about a month I got an email asking me to fly to Redmond for a day of onsite interviews. I gladly flew to Redmond. Treatment and process was really good. Everything went smoothly and they even gave money to spend on food and exploring Seattle. As for the actual interviews there were 4 back to back interviews. The first 3 were more based on coding on a white board and typical behavioral questions. The 4th one was a design based interview.

First went through University Recruiting. On-campus interview had one tech question: check if you have a valid combination of '(', '{', '['. Second round, aka final round was on-site in Seattle. Each has a 45-min duration and you have a 15 minutes break in between 4 interviews in this round. First one: given the pointer to a head node that contains 2 pointers pointing to any other 2 nodes(like a simplified graph), you need to make a deep copy of this graph. Second one: check if a BST is a valid BST Third one: given a list of stock prices, you need to find the date when you buy and sell the stock so that your profit is max Fourth one: you have a stream, you need to check if the stream contains a specific string in it. The stream can tell you if it is EOF. You cannot use any STL; you need to write strlen if you need it, you need to write IsSubstring if you want to use it.

The first and the last one are fairly complicated. Mainly because the first one you need to DFS/BFS the graph and then use a hashmap to prevent re-creating existing nodes. The second is such a test for your pointer arithmetic and manipulation................   Answer Question

The first interview was short, 30-45 minutes. The final round of interviews took most of the day. There were 3 interviews(however the number can range from 2-5 depending on who scheduled them for you), each lasting maybe an hour, maybe more. They told me the following week that I didn't get the job. The questions ranged from difficult to easy. It never felt like a grueling test, it felt more like a conversation about algorithms.

Phone interview, followed by on-campus interview. Real meat is in the on-location interview though. Essentially, from 8-5 I met with various current employees of different ranks in the team I was going to work with. Questions were either standard conversation fair, probing the depths of your understanding of certain problems, standard algorithm-focused coding interviews, and even some pure brainteaser questions.

I mentioned I had done the AI for a video game. I told them I used A* for pathfinding, but when they probed me on it I admitted I used a library implementation, and didn't understand the algorithm in detail. I was then tasked with trying to derive it, knowing that it essentially boils down to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm + a bias.   1 Answer

Microsoft came to the job fair at my university, where I was able to talk to one of the engineer, and submitted my resume. The university recruiter responsible for my university sent me an email a few days later, inviting me to the on-campus interview. The 1st round of on-campus interview was not difficult. I was asked to merge 2 sorted linked lists. Since I finished it quickly, I get to ask a lot of questions. Around 2 weeks after the 1st interview, I got an email from the university recruiter that I passed the 1st round. Another recruiter from Redmond would get in touch with me. After another 2 weeks, I got an email inviting me to interview on-site. It was difficult to schedule the interview at a time that suits me -- there were several recruiters, several schedulers, you know, big corporation. But they do try to accommodate my requests and we finally managed to find a date that makes everyone happy. The interview day started very early. We were asked to wait in our hotel lobby at 6:45 am. The van left at 7:00 am. The recruiter met us in the lobby of the building at 7:30. She gave a presentation about Microsoft, the interview schedule, etc. And we started to interview with the engineers at 8:00. There were 4 rounds of interviews, 45 minutes each, with 15 minutes break in between. Afterwards, the whole group went to have lunch together. When we came back, the recruiter talked to us one by one, informing us about the results right away.

I applied online on my college job portal and got a mail from the recruiter 3 weeks later asking me to schedule a 30 mins on-campus interview. The interviewer was very friendly and asked a lot of questions from my resume and prev work experiences. After that she asked me to design an employee feedback application that would record the employee's goals/ achievements and the manager would review it. I was asked to come up with design pattern for this problem and think of all possible test cases. It was a very open-ended question so I wasn't sure I covered all. Nevertheless got a call after 15 days asking me to come onsite. I had 4 1:1 technical rounds on-site. All the interviewers were very friendly. They gave us a tour of the campus and took us to the store. They really treat the candidates well and gave us pretty awesome coupons to be used at the store. The interviews were a mixture of coding, design, behavioural, puzzles and resume questions. A lot of distributed network questions were asked. It is good to have an all-rounded preparation. Don't just concentrate on Data structures and OOPS. Some of the questions were: "How would you design the swimming pool for a resort in Mexico?" "What data structure would you use for a website like Ancestry.com and how and why." Had to write code for this "You have a website that displays the stock prices of every company everyday with trends. How would you test the accuracy of data displayed in the website?" "You have billions of strings sorted in an array. You don't have any access to it. You just have a method that returns the string pertaining to a index. Use only that method to find the location of a given string" I started out at 0(n^2) and kept on improving to o(logn) After that, they gave me the results very next day. That was pretty nice of them.

Two rounds of interviews on-campus at my school, followed by on-site interviews. On-site interviews were in a large group of students, with two interviews back-to-back followed by lunch. Everyone received decisions after lunch. Overall things were pretty smooth. I heard back quickly after each round of interviews, and Microsoft paid for all expenses while traveling there for the on-site round. Definitely one of the smoother experiences I've had. The only downside is they don't have access to any feedback when giving your result, which means they can't even tell you how long until you can reapply (because it depends on how close you were to hire/no hire), so you'll have to email your recruiter separately and hope for a response.

Recruiter came on campus and I was able to go on campus directly for an interview. I expressed interest in an UI role and they matched me with the least UI relevant team possible, which pretty much made me lose interest in my interviews. I didn't find out until interview day. Interviews vary depending on your performance and what the team needs, so they tell you 3-5. I got away with 4.5. The team asked a lot of data structures questions, which was fine, I struggled an appropriate amount and answered most of them. They seemed to be fine with my answers. Then my last interview was with the hiring manager, who basically told me no on the spot. He pretty much made circles with his words to avoid telling me no, which was kind of stupid. He told me that my experience was not enough for them and that I should go make some apps or do TopCoder. I was fine with not getting the job, but was not fine with the fact that I wasted my entire day interviewing for a team I had zero interest. I also felt that they should not have accepted the interview in the first place if they saw I didn't have relevant experience.

I applied online and got reply after one month. I was asked to arrange a phone interview or skype interview. I chose skype because it would be more comfortable for me. Skype or phone interview are exactly the same since the interviewer would not request for a video chat through skype. There were three questions for me and nothing were technical which was really a surprise. The questions were as follows: 1. How would you test a keyboard? 2. How would you design an alarm clock for blind people? 3. There are three baskets with apples, oranges and mix of apples and oranges. Each basket has a tag with apple, orange or mix. Now we know that all the three tags are wrong. You have only one opportunity to pick one fruit from one basket. How you will choose to identify these three baskets? Later, he asked me about my interest and my project experience according to me interest. The interviewer is very kind and professional.

The communication started through career fair. When I gave my Resume to one of their representative (current Engineer at Microsoft), he quickly asked few questions to get to know about my background. Later he told me that he would forward this to one of the recruiter and he will contact me if there is a suitable match. I had to raise my eyebrow here, cause the guy has my Resume and he asked me several questions. This alone should be enough to proceed ahead with interview or no interview. Reading other posts, it seems MS conducts onsite campus interviews, then why forward to recruiter. Perhaps, due to lower reputation of my university, they do not want to spend too much time interviewing people onsite. A couple of weeks later, I got an email to schedule a phone interview. At last, something is better than nothing as I get about half an hour to prove my capacity. I have gone through interview posts here on Glassdoor and I could not find any details on phone interviews. Most were either college interviews or people talking about their onsite interviews after passing phone interview. In any case, I prepared myself with the questions posted and later on I realized those were overkill for the phone interview. Now, I have gone through plenty of phone interviews with multiple tech giants. In most cases, I have made it to later rounds in phone interview, but no onsite though. Well, I just want to say I have become quite comfortable with these initial interviews, both technically and behaviorally. The interviewer called on time and we started with discussing my background. This was already done when I submitted my Resume, so I see no point in reiterating all this. Although, I was asked similar questions in my past interviews, but on those occasions, I did not forward my Resume personally and the initial phone calls were the first time when I spoke to someone inside the company. Next I was asked several semi-technical and behavioral questions. Most of these questions are already discussed elsewhere, therefore I will not emphasize much on those. However, I will mention some of them below, cause I think it's on these questions I may have under performed. As for other questions, I am sure "Design a Table", "Test an Elevator" and "Determining Apple, Orange and Apple-Orange from incorrectly labelled boxes" should ring a bell or you will certainly encounter them if you search on internet. Few days later, I got the usual no offer email. The only positive thing I can take is they told me to reapply in 6 months. From what I know, they usually give a 1 year clause, therefore this was a good rejection, I hope. I did give some ridiculous answers which could be a good reason for rejection. I will discuss them in Question sections below. Perhaps you guys could judge if this is certainly worth getting a rejection.

Everything about Microsoft's interview process is great! Start - Apply on website / on-campus / through recruiter First - Phone screen / on campus interview (EASY) Second - Fly out to Seattle for full day interviews (MEDIUM) End - You usually get a few weeks to reply to the offer, I got a month They usually don't tell you what team you'll be interviewing for, but it doesn't matter. They don't ask you anything specific about the team anyway. Almost everything in the Seattle trip is covered including room service, rental car, meals, etc. They really treat their candidates well. The interviews take a few hours (4 rounds of 45-50minute interviews on a whiteboard at their office) and range from medium to hard difficulty. They don't tell you too much about the company/offer/process from the get-go but are very friendly and respond to any questions you have quickly. I would highly recommend going through this process especially if you have a negative impression of Microsoft. The 'evil' rumors just simply aren't true - and the company is great. Their compensation package is top-notch and would easily match Google/Facebook/etc. The disposable income you get is probably more than you'd get anywhere else given that Washington has 0% state income tax, and the living expenses in Seattle are reasonable.

Had a number of discussions with HR recruiters, followed by a two phone screens (one position I declined on the screen right away) and the second phone screen resulting in on-campus interviews for two positions. Scheduled for 6-one hours interviews + lunch with a co-worker. However, one of the two jobs got filled before my interview so I ended up speaking with just one group, 5-one hour interviews + lunch session (fairly standard MS procedure). Every one was really good to talk to. No need to fake anything. Be honest. Say you don't know to things you don't know or can't remember on the spot. Ask questions. Be social. The people you speak to are going to be your peers and mentors so they need to feel a sense of comfort with you too. You need to show your willingness to learn and being open to their ideas and suggestions. Don't make the mistake that I made -- stayed up for 26 hours before catching 3 hours of sleep and then going into the interview. By the end of the day, you are so numb and brain dead. Get plenty of sleep, light breakfast. For some reason, every interview asked me if I need to use the rest room before and after every session... Anyway, good to place to work, great overall interview experience minus the one hiccup about the job being filled after I was invited to interview for the role.

Got a mail requesting for an interview at University. The interviewer asked questions about my experience and a coding question involving multiple threads and some general algos questions. After clearance, recruiter contacted me to schedule onsite interviews at Redmond. At the campus, the day started with a chat with HR and then a total of 6 technical rounds(including 1 lunch technical round, from different teams in the Core OS group). Questions asked were generally core OS(multithreading, deadlocks, concurrency), algorithms(simple ones with complete coding) and some on work experience. Overall, the experience was nice and the interviewers were very friendly. Two days later, I got a reject mail. The reason for my reject(acc to me) is my substandard implementation of a stack using an array compounded by my miserable performance in the last round. I felt that the interviewers exchange the performance of the candidate about a possible weakness and the next interviewer will look to confirm that, and if that's the case, the red flags would be raised.

TO be honest, I never thought my experience with microsoft soft would be like this. I was contacted by a recruiter through email. I had an initial phone screen and it went well and was invited for an onsite interview. The first person who interviewed me was nice and kind. This round went well. The second interviewer was late by about 15 mins while I was waiting in the lobby. The person invited me to his room and started the interview. The question was not clear at all and the person just turned her back on me and started typing an email on her desktop. I thought she was giving me some time to think but when I had a solution, I tried to let her know by calling out her name. She did not acknowledge! Can you believe it??? I was literally standing behind her for 10 minutes telling her that I have a solution. She did not like my solution so moved onto the next question. While I had different solutions, she had something in mind (Note: She was still typing on her computer faced against me) At last, when I asked what was the solution to the second question, she was like 'Thats too many lines of code. I cannot explain'. The rudest interview of my life. After that, it pretty much set the mood for me for the rest of the day. The other interviews were fine and I was really upset. I even contacted the recruiter and let him know about my feedback but haven't gotten any reply yet. Not even to the result of the interview. My advice is: I dont know if all of microsoft interview experiences are like this, but we vary of these kind of interviewers.

I communicated via email with an interview scheduler to fly out to Redmond. I had already passed the first round at an on-campus interview, so the on-site interview was scheduled within a couple of weeks. For the actual interview day, it started with the HR rep asking basic questions to make sure you fit the position at all, and then she directed me to my first interviewer. The interviewers would then take you to the next one in your schedule, and they would talk about you to each other in between. FYI, if you're honest to your HR rep about any concerns you might have about the position, the other interviewers will see them and do their best to persuade you otherwise. The interview questions were not as bad as I worried - the questions were very reasonable and could definitely be done in the interview time. There were some things that they asked me about that I freely admitted to not knowing, and then they'd give me a question about it and see if I could figure things out without the prior knowledge. I definitely got the impression that for fresh out of college hires, they don't expect comprehensive knowledge of anything, just raw talent and an ability to think through things. Just be relaxed and enthusiastic and connect to the interviewers. The interviewers were all very friendly and genuinely enthusiastic about their work, and by the last interview they were very clear that they liked me. I received the offer the next day.

I don't want to list the specific questions, but I thought all the questions were very fair - some design problems, some algorithms, some data structures, pointers.   Answer Question

I was contracted by a Microsoft recruiter though LinkedIn. Had a phone screen with the recruiter talking about my background and a technical phone interview 1 week later.

Interview questions includes white board coding, system design and some other open questions. All of the interviewers are pretty nice and friendly, they focus on how you approach the problem and communicate with them. I was interviewed on Thursday and got an offer on the following Tuesday.

1. Design a String class. Then write code to implement Insert(). Discuss performance about Insert and Lookup. The goal is to fine a solution that achieves O(logN) for both Insert and Lookup. 2. Write code for Push/Get to implement a ring buffer based on a fixed size char buffer. 3. Communication between Client/Server for a remote file system is based on a unreliable link (99% up-time but sometimes packet can be dropped). The client can send request like Open, Read, Write, Seek, Close, Create, Delete to the server. How would this system deal with packet loss?

Phone screening for software research. Mostly background stuff with one technical question. I was asked to create a function to check if a binary tree is sorted. I used a recursive solution that, at first, failed in some cases. The interviewer pointed that out there was a bug, I found the problem and devised a different solution. My second solution was correct but the interviewer disagreed. Told her I couldn't find the bug she was referring to, and that I'd email her with a correction as soon as I did. After some research and consideration, it turned out I was correct, so a weird process overall. Didn't get an offer.

Initially turned in my resume during a campus career fair. Approximately two weeks later I was emailed by a recruiter who asked me to participate in an on-campus interview (i.e., first round). The campus interview was with someone who wasn't a recruiter and had clear technical expertise. This interview lasted approximately 25-30 minutes. We mostly talked about items on my resume, whether or not I faced any unique challenges and if so, how I overcame them. This was a very conventional interview. Upon the conclusion, I was asked a technical question. About three weeks later, I was emailed again by a different recruiter who asked me if I was available to fly out to Redmond, WA for the second round interview. I had a very compact window to interview within, and the recruiters did a great job setting everything up within my constraints. On interview day, the first step is to meet with another recruiter who is on-site, who will discuss the group / team you will be interviewing with, and answer any other questions you may have at the time. This recruiter is also the one who will tell you the results, and work further with you should you get an offer. After meeting the recruiter, you take a personal shuttle to the buildings where your interviewers are. Mine were all in the same building. Next you meet with 3-5 interviewers, and one of the interviews is a lunch interview. You are told beforehand that each interviewer passes on comments to the next one, presumably so they can confirm / deny a weakness. For me, the first interviewer didn't want to talk about my resume at all. He was more or less the manager of the group and was very blunt about the skills he was looking for. Some non-technical questions were: "What would you change about Windows?", "What do you read to stay on top of the latest technology?", "What are some examples of trending applications?". Then he went to the coding problems. One a mathematical proof, and the second more coding oriented. The next interview was over lunch, and this interviewer asked me initially about my research, but quickly started trending towards questions that were more oriented towards the group. After lunch we went back to his office and I was asked another coding problem. The third interview was more theoretical. The interviewer briefly talked about my research and that it looked interesting, and then we went into an open-ended math / optimization problem. After the third interview, I was told that I would not be seeing the fourth interviewer (this means you failed), and I was taken back to HR to discuss the day with the recruiter. I should point out that the recruiter was very helpful and looked into other groups that might have been a better fit. Overall, the interview was very challenging. You absolutely need to be prepared to code and solve difficult problems. The second round is not about what you have done, but rather what you can do now, in a high-pressure situation. Also, you are told that you can code in any language, but in reality, you need to be able to code in C/C#. Not being familiar with either, I tried to use Python so as to not get bogged down in syntax, but it was generally not well received.

On Campus / First Round 1) Write a function that returns the indexes of a character in a string Second Round 1) Prove that for a set of numbers that are {prime -> non-prime -> prime} (ex. 11, 12, 13) the non-prime number is always divisible by six. 2) Write a class that adds or removes data from a queue 3) Write a class that can store and interpret large integers (i.e., numbers that cannot be stored as an int). The class must be able to perform mathematical operations on the represented data. 4) You are an owner of a building, which has a broken revolving door. What time do you replace the door?   1 Answer

First I had an on-campus interview with a recruiter with an easy coding question. A bit later they told me they wanted to fly me out to Redmond for on-site interviews. First I met with a recruiter who told me what the rest of the day was going to be like, then they called a shuttle to take me to another building for the interviews themselves. The first interviewer greeted me in the lobby, took me to the kitchen to offer me a drink, then led me to his office for the first interview. Each interviewer generally started by asking me about myself, asked a coding question, asked me to optimize my solution, asked how I should test my solution, then gave me some time to ask them any questions I had. This took about 45 minutes total per interview. Then they would take me to the kitchen to offer me another drink then pass me off onto the next interviewer. One interviewer in the middle took me to lunch, where we ordered our food and took it to his office to eat during the interview. I think there were 5 interviews total, all with members of the same team. Then I took a shuttle back to the first building, where the recruiter from that morning did a debriefing and sent me on my way. They were all very nice throughout the process, and when I asked them questions, they were very honest in their responses, telling me both the pros and cons of working at Microsoft. The company was also very generous with respect to what they would pay for, especially food.

I got a summer internship offer from microsoft two days ago. So excited, yeah, still... I studied so hard for the interviews, so the offer carries special meaning! During my prep process, reviews on Glassdoor helped me a lot. So I am here to share my experience, and hope it'll be helpful to other job/internship seekers. Round 1 phone interview: 1. properties of good code 2. tell me about your projects 3. how did you test your projects. 4. how to test a keyboard. 5. You come home and realise that you forgot your key, how will you try to get in. Round 2 onsite interview: 1. a deck of cards is represented by an array of integers. how do you implement Shuffle function. Test your function. 2. how to test a phone. 3. tell me something about your favorite technology product. Is there anything on it you wanna improve. 4. how to test a game. 5. Suppose today, you have a bunch of meetings, and some projects are due, and some coworker is asking you to help him out. how would you prioritize? 5. how to divide a chunk of memory two-dimensionally into pieces of memory of different sizes. come up with the data structure. The onsite interview was such a memorable experience! Seattle is an amazing city. Hope my review helps! Good luck!

I submitted my resume online. But it was at the end of year (in december) and the HR said they will be contacting me only in jan or Feb as they normally freeze the hiring fr new grads at that time. As said they contacted me in Feb and asked scheduled a time for a phone screening with one of the dev engineers. The phone screening was normal. The person who contacted me was easy to communicate with. He asked about myself, the projects i worked with and what are my interests and what products that interests me and which team I would like to work with in Microsoft. This was to get an overall idea of where your interest lies in and which team would be a fit for you. Followed by it was a simple algorithm question on linked list to delete a node and to do it in optimized way. Have to give out all the corner cases. After nearly two weeks they called me for an onsite interview. And the process was pretty smooth. Every day i used to receive mails from HR of the things that I need to do and about the travel ad stay. And even received a 'best wishes' mail from them prior to the day of interview. On the day of interview, I was interviewed by 5 people. It involves both technical and behavioral questions. Interview was held at cubicles of the respective engineers and managers. First interview was about detailing my resume. He asked about all the projects that was in my resume. So be well prepared. And also asked if I had any conflicts with other people on the course of project work and how I resolved it. Followed by it was white board coding problems. First it was about how i approach the problem and then have to write a code. Asked about time complexity. Second interview was about the projects again. And he asked me particularly about my internship project. And then asked to solve a problem. We discussed the pros and cons of my approach and then asked to write code. Asked for time complexity. For one problem he asked about the downfall for the approach and then asked if i could find a way to resolve it. I gave him the solution and was moved to the third interview. Third interview was lunch interview. I had no clue about the team I am going to interview with before that morning. And that is the policy of Microsoft not to let the candidates know the team they are going to interview with. So you cant research about them. And so lunch interview is all about you talking. Be ready to question and speak. It all about it. How much you are interested in the job and the team and how good are you at communicating. I started with business model of the team, architecture, technologies used, compared with other technologies, competitors, new features. I also commented on the negative aspects of the product and compared with the features of others. But don't stop talking. If you do well with first three interviews then you will be invited for the fourth one. My fourth interview was more about coming up with my data structure for the problem and then solving a given problem and writing an API. Try to start with normal approach and to make it optimized. And speak your thoughts, even if it may be wrong. They are more than willing to help you out if you are struck. Again this one involved the conflicts you encountered and your influence on any project. It need not be something big. Just show them that you have your opinion and you are in a position to voice it. If you get through the fourth interview , you will be invited for fifth one with the dev manager or director of the team. This one is not technical, but purely you interest again. It was again 60 min of interview. And after one day I was informed that I got selected.

Nothing unexpected. But be prepared to talk about the conflicts you faced and how you overcame it. And your interests. You resume.   Answer Question 1. Find an element in a 2D sorted array(sorted row wise and column wise ) in O(n) complexity. 2. Finding common ancestor in BST and Binary tree. 3. Reverse a linked list with and without recursion.

I posted the questions below. This post is focused on the final onsite interview not the hr or first round interview. I really didn't like the process. I was interviewing for sde but got mostly design questions nothing on data structures and algorithms. If you are good at designing software architectures(the UML+implementation) then you would have aced it. Only 3 interviews for me. Some advice the process is so random, you can get easy interview questions or hard ones. So I think getting hired is mostly based on luck and the focus of the questions they ask you and how experienced the interviewer is. 2 of my interviewers were at microsoft for a long time so they were really cooperative, one guy was pretty new there and wasn't very responsive when I told him my solution. Like I said I applied for sde but all the questions were mostly on design nothing about algorithms. no testing, no time complexity analysis.

Microsoft came to our campus and I submitted the resume. Was originally scheduled an on-campus interview but it was cancelled by hurricane Sandy. So they had a phone interview. The phone interview was not hard, I was asked to compare two binary trees to see if they are identical, and to design a vendor machine. After two weeks I got an email about further steps, seems like MSFT has a long candidate line so I was scheduled an on-site interview on January. Candidates were gathering in the lobby of building 111 and recruiters came one after another to talk with us. Then we are given the info of interviewers and they had shuttles to take us to different buildings. The interviewers are nice, they tried to be inspiring and helped me through the technical questions. I was sort of unsatisfied about the later interviewing process because after the fourth interviewer, I was sent to the fifth guy and was told that I need to wait for an hour. After waiting in the lobby for 45 mins, the guy showed up and told me that my day was over. I didn't expect that I could get an offer from Microsoft, but keeping ppl waiting and then letting them go is definitely not professional.

The interview process was amazing: I was very satisfied. This company paid upfront for me everything (an intercontinental flight, a suite in Marriott Inn's for 3 nights, room service, taxi, etc.). The first meeting was with my on-site recruiter in building 111: we spoke about my opportunities in Microsoft and the things I like to do. Then, a Microsoft Shuttle took me to building 36, when Office is developed and I did 4 interviews of about 1 hour each, plus the "lunch" interview which consists in having lunch with one of your interviewers and mainly speaking about what you like to do (favorite programming languages, IDEs and things like that). The interviewer also explained me in what exactly consists his work.

The weren't many technical questions. Mainly we spoke about my thesis and my previous projects. The "difficult" thing was the coding questions. To say the truth, I think the problems were simply: a talented programmer should not have problems to solve them.   Answer Question

Although I did not get a job offer, overall it was a nice experience. Now here, I have to nullify a myth. They say that if you get 5 interviews and if the last one is with a senior manager, then you'd get a job. NOPE. NEVER. I got five interviews and the last one was with a very nice senior person working there for 35 years and still I got rejected. Went to Redmond a few months ago in a snowy winter day! There were five interviews: 1) A very strict (but polite) person, no smile on the face, explicitly telling me that he wont help me and wont give me any hints. It was all about quickly writing a bug-free C++ code to find a pattern in a string, implementing a post order tree traversal with and without recursion and a few research/design problems. 2) An extremely nice korean guy who asked about hash tables/lookup/insert/collision in HT and implementation in C++. There was another question about writing all permutations of a given string. 3 and lunch interview) A very nice person, willing to help: He told me to develop an algorithm for finding whether a matrix has some properties or not. It was 5 months ago and I forgot the question. I could solve the question but he was looking for a more efficient algorithm. He was willing to help and gave me hints but time was up and he gave me to the next interviewer. he told me that I was going to the right direction. 4) The fourth interviewer was very odd. I hope his behavior was planned/intentional and he is not like this. From our conversation, it was obvious that this guy is very smart. He wrote a long input string with lots of delimiters in the white board and asked me to write a c-code to change the given string it to another format based on some rules. It was a horribly vague, twisted question with lots of unknowns and exceptions. In the interview, he was taking nap time to time and he left the room at least three times. Again I hope that this was a test to see my reaction. The reason that I hope for the best is that at the end of the interview, he was the only person who gave me very honest feedbacks and compliments. But if it is not the case, that was awfully/extremely rude. So he passed me to the final interviewer... 5) a senior manager, working in MS for 35 years. Very cool, very smart and very fun, It could be easily observed by the flags/decoration in the room/some wine on the table in his room!!! By the way, I didnt have any whatsoever behavioral questions during my day. So this time, he just started chatting with me which I guess was the behavioral part of the interview. Talking about everything except work, about big corporations, hacking!! and so on. It was truly an amazing experience with that person. Based on the book, I surely have gotten the job, but ....One week later, I got rejected.

1-hour technical phone screen 8-hour on-site technical interview (including with hiring-manager) After this round I was told by a recruiter that although the team generally thought I was competent, they didn't unanimously feel I was the right fit for this team. This was probably accurate since I didn't ask many insightful questions about the team during the on-site. So, the recruiter forwarded my resume to a few other teams... and I began the entire process again. 2x 1-hour technical phone screen (with 2 different teams) 1-hour in-person technical screen 2x 6-hour on-site interviews In all honesty, I found both of these teams to be more interesting. I asked more insightful questions and I believe that contributed to getting an offer.

I got in touch with them by a referral from someone at my University who got a job offer with them. First there was a very simple phone interview in which they asked some pretty varied questions, such as how I would explain the internet to a young kid and how I would test a vending machine. They always finish with a small logic puzzle which are pretty easy and you've probable even worked with if you've been programming for a while. Afterwards, you're supposed to fly to Redmond but they gave me a 50/50 thing, where I would take 2-3 interviews by phone to screen you, and if you pass you fly to Redmond for the last batch. The interviewer by phone asked me some questions about pointers, recursion, and some basic data structures, but he took it as in depth as possible. Definitely brush up on your Data Structures. After this, I got sent to Redmond where I had 2 interviews. One was with someone from MS Office. She was a charming lady who just portrayed peace to me, so it was really nice. She asked me to write a pre-order traversal that worked iteratively instead of recursively. This wasn't bad at all but again: data structures. My next interview was with a guy from server (Azure to be more specific). He asked me to make a Stack, but he took it down to ever little. Since I wanted it do it with a Linked List he asked me to implement a Linked List first and just kept squeezing every little detail out. Afterwards, he asked me to make it thread safe which was very easy. Then he through a trick question at me about how exceptions would make my stack fail...and I didn't get the answer. About 45 mins later a guy from HR took me to a room to tell me that I didn't get the position. He was very cool about it and MS Staff is extremely friendly, which is somewhat bad since it's harder to read how you do. All in all, great experience and I hope to make it next year.

Having a stack that's thread safe, if the pop() method goes inside the if clause and context switches right before throwing an EmptyStack exception, when it context switches, and in the context switch a value is pushed into that stack, it will throw the EmptyStack exception even though it's not empty.

As a returning intern I was

Most of the technical questions, I felt very prepared for. The most difficult questions were behavioral. In particular, "Tell me about an experience where a project partner enjoyed working with you." Rather than talking about your skills you have to talk about how you worked well with others in a way that they enjoyed working with you, and do so without coming off as being arrogant. Also, they didn't ask the question directly, but came to it in a way that put you on the back foot. The question immediately before was to tell them about a time that you had difficulty working with a partner, and also about a time that a partner had difficulty working with you.   1 Answer

They flew me in for a full day interview. I was greeted in the morning by HR and shuttled off to meet the folks I'd be working with for interviews. It started well but went downhill. They were very aggressive with the questions they asked and how they went about it. I like to think through my answers verbally -- but anytime I said something they didn't like, they would derail my train of thought picking away at it, making it difficult to approach things systematically. Overall, the technical questions weren't that difficult, but their style of interview made it difficult and somewhat unpleasant.

I first got an interview by handing in my resume at a career fair. I chatted with the guy a bit, but he wasn't the chief recruiter so I didn't expect much. However, 2 weeks later I got a notice that I would have an on campus interview. The interviewer seemed kind of awkward and I didn't get the programming question right, but to my surprise I got an email a week later saying I would be flying out to Redmond to interview. Although the email said I would have flexibility in scheduling, when I was contacted 5 days later, it was with a "you're flying out this Thursday" (they notified me of this Monday). Couldn't get it rescheduled, but hey, it's Microsoft. I flew out for their 2 day interviewing event for the Online Services Division, during which they comp you plane tickets, hotel for 2 nights, money for cabs, and stipends for meals. They take you out in a limo bus on the night before interviews to "meet recruiters", but overall that was pretty useless and you basically just start stressing out with all your fellow interviewees. The next day you have 3-5 45 minute interviews (each is 1:1). They're pretty difficult, but the nice thing is they give you your results (offer or no offer) right after you finish. Overall it's a stressful process, one which is unnecessarily drawn out. But the interviewers on site were overall pleasant people. The whole process just feels a little bit like an episode of American Idol.

My interview was for a MSIT SDE position, so my experience may have been somewhat different from interviews with product groups. I had my resume given to a recruiter by a classmate who was recently hired by Microsoft. I was given a phone interview in December, and on the phone was told that I would be contacted for an in-person interview at the Redmond Campus. I flew in on a Thursday, and Microsoft put on a meet-and-greet event for all of the candidates. Free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and I think helps candidates relax and gain a bit of confidence before interview day. In January, I received information and scheduling for my on-site interview. Microsoft paid for my flight, hotel, food and other costs. In February I was informed the interview would consist of four 1 hour interviews, at the end of which I would find out whether or not I would be given an offer. I flew in on a Thursday, and Microsoft put on a meet-and-greet event for all of the candidates that evening. There was free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and really helped me relax and gain a bit of confidence before the interview day. We were given packets that had our schedule for the next day, stating whether you would interview in the morning or afternoon group. **The Interview** We were shuttled to the Microsoft campus, where we had breakfast and a brief meeting with the recruiters before our first interview. First Interview: Met with a SDET who had been with Microsoft for over a decade, and had been a PM previously. Very friendly, asked mainly general questions about my experience, what I'm interested in, etc. Then, he asked me to design a subscription service system. After asking a few questions I found that he wanted the tech stack that I would build it on, with justifications for some of the choices. Overall, this interview went very well. Second Interview: I met with a PM who asked me some more general questions, asked me about a previous project I had worked with. No technical questions, and this interview also went quite well. Third Interview: Meeting with a SDET who asked me about past experience, how I got into software engineering (since I'm an MIS major). He then asked me how I would test the whiteboard, followed by how to test a piece of paper. Finally he asked me to write a method to remove all instances of a certain character from a string. He then modified it asking for how to remove a string of sequential characters from a string. The testing questions threw me a bit initially, but I still felt pretty good by the end of the interview. Fourth Interview: Met with an SDE who briefly asked me about my resume, then jumped into questions on OOP. Can you explain OOP to me. What is a class? What is an object? What is multiple inheritance and what are its drawbacks? Does C# or Java allow multiple inheritance? How is this problem solved? Finally she asked me to reverse a linked list, which I completely botched. I had seen it several times before, but just couldn't get the algorithm right. I didn't solve it before our time ran out, and had to leave it unfinished. At this point, I was feeling pretty nervous about my outcome. We were taken to lunch and when we returned, we were told our results would be given to us shortly. My name was called first, which I assumed meant the worst. The recruited told me, "I hate to do this to you, but we want you to meet with one more member of the team." I had a final interview with another SDE, he was very direct and jumped right into the technical question. I was asked to write a method to find the max int in an unordered binary tree. I nailed this question, which I think got me the offer. I was later told that they sometimes ask for an additional interview to determine fit within the team, how true this is I don't know. I then returned to the lobby to wait a bit more to hear my results, and was finally called back and told I was getting an offer. Final Thoughts / Advice The process is pretty intense but also very enjoyable. If you can, make sure to attend the event the night before the interview. It helps you gain confidence, because you get to see them as normal people, not some sort of mythical geniuses. Plus, by being sociable, displaying interest and being excited about the opportunity, you can put yourself in a good position with potential interviewers. My surprise fifth interview was with a guy who I had a pretty good conversation with the night before and joked a bit with during the event.

The interview process was very smooth. However, as Microsoft is a giant company, I suspect that this depends largely on the recruiters that a candidate works with. After 2 phone interviews, one of which is a screening from the recruiter, I was invited for an on-site at their headquarters, with the SQL Azure group. All 5 interviewers were nice and enjoyed interviewer me. Three of them are super sharp and I learned a hell lot during the interview day. To put my experience into context, I also interviewed and received offers from Facebook and Palantir. The interviews at these companies, although difficult, felt more like programming tests with little time for high level research discussions.

Met with the collage recruiter in career fair. Then had a 1.1 interview on the campus. After a few weeks on-site is offered. Then it is rescheduled for the next month. On site consisted of 5 1.1 interviews. First you meet with your recruiter chat about your hobbies or your plans for your career. Then, she directs you to the first interviewer. Each interviewer escorts you to the next one. The third one is most of the time lunch interviewer. During the lunch he may ask about your projects or some technology related questions. Then, I had two more interviews. The forth one was with a lead dev and the last one was with a manager. Don't think that you will get the job if you made to the manager. At least that's not happened in my case. I got the nearly all the questions right during the day. Asked a lot of questions about company, technologies they are using or about the products. However, in the end since a lot of people are applying they have the chance to very picky. Overall, everything was really smooth and professional. Probably I'll apply again in the future. Good luck to all of you.

The process began when I gave my resume to a recruiter at our yearly engineering career fair (in October). She asked me a couple generic questions about my resume ("tell me about this position", "what's something hard you encountered") and why I wanted to work at MS. She took the resume and I got a call a week later about scheduling an on-campus interview. The on-campus interview occurred about a week after, in early November. This interview (and every interview after) had the format of: 5-10 min "tell me about yourself/resume", 30 min technical question, and the rest of the time "do you have any questions for me?" I felt like the interview went well and I was invited to an MS hiring event weekend in December for a day of interviews. When mid-December rolled around, I flew to Seattle and was put up in the Westin Bellevue. The first night, all software and hardware recruits (about 80 of us, for internships & full-time offers) were taken to an event at the Lucky Strike bowling alley where there was lots of good food, an open bar, and bowling. We also got a chance to talk to our recruiters and ask them any questions about the interview process. The next day, we had 4 interviews in a row. One group had interviews in the morning (8 - 12) and the others had theirs in the evening (1 - 5). We found out which group we were in the night before. In addition the morning group had lunch after the interviews and the late group had lunch before. Each group of interviewees met in the same room before the interviews (to eat lunch) and between them. Most people wore business casual attire. The schedule was: interview, 15 minute break, interview, 30 minute video about working at MS, interview, 15 minute break, interview. Interviewers would call us one at a time from the room before the interview, take us to a room to conduct the interview, and then take us back after. At the end of the day, we all went to the same building to play XBOX games and play with the MS surface. Then, our recruiters called us one-by-one to privately tell us if we received the offer or not. I'm glad I got the offer, but the recruiter first quizzed me on how I thought I did and if I had any other offers, and the strong points of my other offers, and how I would feel or what I would do if I did get an offer. I thought that was a little low, since it seemed like she was toying with me and I still didn't know if I had the offer or not at that point. Nonetheless, I was very happy once I got an offer and to hear the terms of the offer, too! I didn't accept on the spot, but my recruiter was hoping I would :P After that, we were taken home in shuttles and free to do what we wanted. I chose to stay an extra night instead of fly home right away and I hung out with some friends in the area. I flew back the next morning. In terms of preparation, I didn't do anything special besides reading the book Programming Interviews Exposed (2nd Ed.) and reading up on interview questions on this site and by Googling (or Binging ;) ). The more you prep, and the more introspective you are about your method of solving a problem, the better. In addition, it's really important to be charismatic and passionate about the position/group you're applying for and to be genuinely interested in finding out if the company is a good fit for you. As cheesy as it sounds, when you have that (and if you prepare ahead of time), then the right job offer will simply present itself.

Applied through the Microsoft website and interviewed on-campus. I was pleased to hear that I was selected to be flown up to Seattle and interview with the online services division (Bellevue, WA not Redmond). I will state early on that I completed the interview process and received no offer - however, with that said, I will be as objective as I can be about the experience. Firstly, understand that although Microsoft does every single thing possible to try to show how "fun" they are, by far the number one thing the interviewers look for is the ability to think and code just like any other large software company. Everyone who says that it's important to be social and personable at Microsoft must have interviewed with a different division. With online services, all that matters is coding, problem solving, and wanting to tackle new problems. During your day you will have four 45 minute interviews, with 15 minute breaks in between. After that you will hear immediately whether or not an offer will be extended. This is absolutely amazing by Microsoft. To have that feedback so instantaneously is incredible and truly first-class of the company. These interviews will be intimidating to say the least and I can virtually guarantee you that you will run into one or two people that you really like and think are cool, and one or two that make you second-guess if you really want to work there. Each interview has a coding question. My four were as follows: 1) Given the in-order and preorder traversals of a binary tree, rebuild the tree. 2) Given a sparse n-by-m matrix, find the number of distinct paths within that matrix (each cell can be off or on, find the number of distinct sets of connected cells). 3) Given the Android 3x3 matrix lock screen, generate all the possible unlock combinations that one can enter. 4) Given an array of integers, find all the unique elements. I botched the first question. It was 8AM in the morning when I attempted it and I had been up since 6:30. To be quite honest, I had forgotten to review the tree algorithms. I met with the interviewer and he literally bombarded me with questions. If you say *anything* be prepared to defend it and back it up. There is also a strong sense that you must be very, very interested in working for Microsoft. As one Microsoftie put it, "the people who work at Microsoft choose to work there because they love Microsoft, it's not that they cannot work for Google or Apple". There is little to no review of your resume. The emphasis is pretty much solely on your ability to code relatively generic, albeit challenging, programming problems. This can work to your advantage or it can be a disadvantage. To ace the interview, simply read a number of programming problems and study up on the division you are interested in. At one point in time, I was asked: "if you were given a farm of 1000 computers, say, what problem would you try to solve?". Find something that Microsoft is trying to solve, or some generic problem in the division for whom you are interviewing. As I was not extended the offer, I cannot precisely tell you what it takes to succeed in the interview. However, here are a couple of observations I made (some of which are listed earlier): 1) Read up on the division for whom you are interviewing and understand their business well. 2) Read up on many, many coding questions. If you read enough problems, chances are you will have heard a problem similar to the one you are trying to solve. 3) I cannot stress this enough, but to succeed you *must* ace the first interview you have. I told you how I botched the first question. I did not think to use recursion. In a later interview I had a question that could have used recursion (implementing a BFS), but I chose the iterative process. The interviewer remarked to me, "your first interviewer noted that you don't use recursion, why don't you?". These interviewers talk to each other in between! As such, you must absolutely make a good first impression. If you can interview with Microsoft, it is a cool experience. You get two free nights in a nice hotel room and all your expenses paid. It makes for an awesome trip to Seattle. However, I really wish Microsoft would cut down on the number of people they bring to Seattle. Reading through Glassdoor, you will see *a lot* of people are not extended offers. Why bring these people if you don't extend a great deal of offers? I feel their current system unfairly generates a lot of false hopes. If you are interviewing with the big M, I wish you the best. You will have a fun experience and it will be really cool to even just walk through those doors once. As the guy who told me the sad end-of-day news put it, "we receive 10,000 resumes a week, and the fact that you made it this far attests to your skills". Be proud that you received the interview and enjoy your experience!

Microsoft came to our campus and shortlisted candidates based on the resumes they submitted. They held brief face to face (~30 mins) interviews in campus over 2 days. I was asked about my educational background, my thesis, research and open ended questions such as: 1. Give a few examples of scenarios where distributed computing could be applied and would be useful. 2. Tell me about a time when you were faced with a difficult problem you couldn't solve. 3. Why is finding a bug in a multiprocessor programming harder than in sequential programming? How would you solve this problem? Next they flew me to Redmond for a day full of one on one interviews (5 in total, 4 technical 1 HR in the end). They took care of accommodation, travel, etc and made me feel very comfortable. The people were very nice and friendly.

I dropped my resume at the Microsoft booth at a career fair. I got an email that had me indicate what timeslots they listed were possible for me, for a phone interview. I also filled out a form to show what position, what development layer, etc I was interested in working in most. I provided my number and my skype name, and said that skype was the most convenient for me. On time, a woman called me on skype (no video) and the interview went right along. She seemed very good at interviewing. It felt very comfortable talking to her, and she made you feel justified in your thinking, and prompted you if you ran out of ideas. The "fun questions" as she called it seemed like brainstorming ideas, anything and everything you think of, you should mention. Get the corner cases, remember safety checks. I got an email 30 minutes after the phone interview ended saying I didn't make the cut. It said I was close, and offered to consider me for a support position, or interview for the developer position again in 2 months. In total, I communicated with 3 different women--the one that scheduled the interview, the interviewer, and the one that followed up on the interview. I asked for feedback/advice from the last woman in my thank-you reply, but she was somewhat dismissive. Otherwise, the vibe I got was okay. Everyone was courteous.

It is college recruiting. The first interview was in college about 1 hour, one coding problem about sorting, just write the pseudo code in a paper, not so difficult, the pressure is timing. Then asked some questions about projects in my resume, and questions like how do you think to improve some Microsoft products like IE etc. Three weeks later I was informed they will fly me to Redmond for onsite interview. I flied from Florida and stayed at Seattle for two nights, Microsoft paid all the trip. The first night is a big dinner party with all other candidates over the country and Microsoft managers/employees who will interview us the next day. The dinner is not interview, just casual party with chatting, get familiar with each other, very friendly. At next day all candidates are divided into two groups, interviewed by morning and afternoon separately. I was in afternoon group, the morning is a bus tour for the Microsoft campus, meeting and talking with HR and engineers, introduced the Microsoft life, sports center, science center etc, they want you to like here, treated like we are one of them already. Actually the HR told us once you are on campus interview, that means basically you are qualified to Microsoft, but they only hire top half of us due to high competitiveness. Afternoon interview has 4 turns, about 1 hour each with different development manager. Each turn has coding question of course, write the pseudo code in white board. They are not very difficult, once you are in good hand in algorithm class, it should be OK, the timing and efficiency is the key. Remember I said they only hire top half of the group, solve as many coding questions as you can in one hour with better efficiency, then you will stand out to the top half. I worked OK to the first and second turn, the managers are friendly, and asked question like how do you think about Microsoft, any question/expectation to Microsoft/product etc. But I failed at third turn, my coding solution looks complicated and inefficient, although I worked out, the manager pointed that and introduced better one to me, of course that means mine is not that good. The fourth turn means nothing then, the interviewer not on the interview mood at all, just asked some unimportant coding/question to pass the time. So the result is obvious. All of us know the result right after the interview finished. They call the failed candidate one by one out of the room and told you very regretfully then you can leave. And the other half who still left in the room are offered... This is college hiring, all the candidates are undergraduate/graduate, the experienced one may be different and more difficult. Someone said since the 4 managers are from different team, if one or two are interested in you, then you may be hired, but by my experience that is not true, you have to pass by all 4 to get offer. The key is practice of coding problems consistently, from easy to hard, in short timing and good efficiency which make you competitive.

The on-site interview consisted of two interviews with team-leads and two interviews with SDE engineers. Most of the questions were C/C++, data structures and algorithm questions. Every interviewer talks to the next interviewer and discusses his opinion on the candidate, they would also change the number of interviewers on the fly.

I submitted my resume to an on-campus recruiter and received an email that same evening. The recruiter wanted to chat on the phone 2 days later, which was was a quick discussion of my background and interests. At the end of the call I was invited to attend a half-day of on-site interviews just 3 days later (after the weekend). The on-site interviews consisted of 4 separate 45 minute 1 on 1 interviews with 4 different Microsoft developers. They asked typical technical design and algorithms questions, and also wanted to spend a lot of time hearing me talk about a project I had worked on in the past. The first interview was very straightforward, but they become progressively more difficult. In later interviews they specifically ask you about topics that your resume indicates you have no experience with, to see how you handle unknown situations. Results were given on the spot by HR, so less than 5 days after first getting in touch with Microsoft a job offer was on the table. Overall an extremely efficient interview process. They are clearly pushing to hire early before top grads get snapped up by their competitors.

Basically, they came to my university and we had a phone interview. After that, they selected a group to fly up to redmond for the weekend and we had a full day of interviews. Each interview is with a different team that you can work with and all operate roughly independently (i.e. if you bomb one, you can still get in with a different team). After that, you wait for each team to decide whether they want you (they typically choose their top few candidates and then get the first one that isnt taken by another group).

I received an interview after giving them my resume during an on campus visit. They promptly contacted me in a few days saying they were interested. I got an on campus interview with a Software Development Engineer. It was a 30 minute interview in which he asked one programming questions. I had to write the code on the board. It wasn't too difficult and he continued to probe my mind while I wrote code such as "why this method, how would you test this, is this the most efficient". I ended up getting a pretty good solution and was confident I did well. Although I was not offered an on-site interview. Thinking back on what I would do differently, I would ask more clarifying questions, and more clearly explain why my solution is optimal. I get pretty nervous sometimes which causes me to not explain terms as clear as they can be. However it was a good experience and good interview practice.

A couple of recruiters came to our school last winter looking for a few candidates. Had an initial screen that was easy as hell. Basically all HR questions. This kind of dodged the phone screens. Got called for an on-site interview after a month and flew to Seattle, WA to interview in their Redmond HQ. The on-site interview consisted of 4 interviews that were 1 hour each. They were technically taxing from start to end. Most of the questions (which I don't really remember now) were not seen/heard of by me. Most involved coding on the whiteboard. I took the algorithm first, code later approach. Most topics dealt with data structures, algorithms and some logical thinking (I got to design/code the initial moves in Checkers).

My first interview was a 30 minute on-campus screen: one puzzle question and a few short, general CS questions. If you know anything at all, this is a piece of cake. The remainder of this review describes my on-site experience. Regarding travel arrangements: I experienced a flight cancellation for my return journey, but the travel team was very supportive and helpful, extending my hotel stay and rebooking my flight. Regarding the interviews: most of the advice and information available here and elsewhere online is quite accurate (just note that they generally do NOT ask “mount Fuji” questions anymore), and as there is a lot of it (if you are unable or too lazy to find it you certainly do not deserve an offer from any company) I will only give a brief outline of my experience. I arrived at the recruiting building in my rental car and managed to find a single open parking spot. After checking in at the desk, I had about 15 minutes to hang out in the lobby area with around 12 other candidates. They provide free drinks, xbox, and some weird machines running a program called something like “tell us about yourself,” which I tried to use unsuccessfully. The recruiter took me to an office where we spent about 15 minutes going over the day, some interview advice, and a little about my goals and background; nothing technical or difficult. The first 30 minutes of my first “real” interview consisted of discussing his and my background and me asking lots of questions about the product since I had never heard of it. The remaining 30 minutes were filled by a problem on sorting: design, complexity, and pseudocode. He had a somewhat similar background so we had no trouble connecting. Next was my lunch interview at a nearby cafeteria. There was a wide selection of reasonably priced food (though I had a voucher for a free lunch). I decided on a salad for ease of eating. We talked about the company, the team and my goals. Back in his office, I worked out two problems on trees coded up in C++. The next interview was entirely coding; two of the questions were easy but the third gave me trouble; it was the craziest recursion I’ve ever seen. Make sure you practice with trees a lot, and don’t bother much with general graphs. The interviewer gave me lots of tips, and I finished the code at the last minute. The fourth interview was more like the earlier ones; relatively informal conversation in the first half followed by a technical question, in this case design. I had to design a data structure to represent the state of a game. Pretty open ended… I think the idea is just to have a dialog about design tradeoffs (memory vs. speed and so on). Finally I was happy to make it to the last interview with an upper level person which involved more discussion of the team and my past experiences—no technical questions. Be sure to have something to say about every item on your resume—difficulties you encountered, what you learned, etc. I briefly met the recruiter again and went back to the hotel. In a few days, I heard the good news from the recruiter. So my advice is: 1) ask questions, be curious, and be enthusiastic about the team/product and the company. If you are having a “conversation“ and not just a dry Q&A, then you are probably doing this well. 2) spend a few minutes verbalizing your ideas before writing any code. 3) don’t code silently. 4) practice coding on paper or a whiteboard before the interview--preferably with someone watching over your shoulder. It really helps! 5) try to learn something from each interview, anything, then use it in a later interview; ESPECIALLY if the interviewer specifically gives you advice. They want you to succeed. Remember this if you get nervous. This is mostly drawn from advice I’ve heard elsewhere, but I found it to be particularly useful. Good Luck! Also, everyone I encountered at Microsoft was very nice and personable. The interviews felt mostly relaxed and enjoyable.

Asked about how to locate a element in an rotated, sorted array. You've been given an array that is sorted and then rotated. example Let arr = [1,2,3,4,5] which is sorted and then rotated say twice to the right to give [4,5,1,2,3] This can be done in O(logN) using a slightly modified binary search. The interesting property of a sorted + rotated array is that when you divide it into two halves, atleast one of the two halves will always be sorted. I am not interested in the groups of developing explorers, so I did not proceed.

Were pretty flexible with scheduling the interview and also took care of travel & hotel expenses.

I was contacted by a Microsoft college recruiter. I initially applied for a Software Development Engineer Intern Position but because I was in my last year of my Master's degree the interviewer told me that I can't apply for an internship position because after the internship I wouldn't be going back to school anymore. So she decided to interview me anyway but consider me for a fulltime position. I wasn't sure if I want to move from my country to the States so I guess this thing was a major black ball for me (I guess). After all the questions were related to the projects I listed on my resume. She asked what was the most technically challenging project I worked for in the past. I didn't review enough my projects because I didn't have enough time and because mostly of them were OS &kernel related and I mostly forgot how I did them and what were the major problems that I had to overcome. So an advice would be to review all the interesting projects that you did in the past in order to answer rapidly and accurately about them. I think this was the major reason that I didn't get an onsite interview (bacause the interviewer couldn't make a clear idea about the projects that I did).

I applied at a campus career fair and was invited to an on-campus interview with Microsoft. The recruiter that scheduled my interview sent me two invitations and three separate confirmations. None of the confirmations were at the same time, and two of them were with different people on top of that. I wrote back to confirm the third confirmation and then showed up at that time only to learn that my interview was scheduled for a different time entirely. The issue was ironed out and my interviewer ended up missing his lunch break to interview me. He asked me a data structure question and had me work out the answer on paper. I worked it out and tried to explain it to him, but he seemed fairly disinterested. He then followed up by asking me how I would test my solution, and then he left. I was pretty frustrated at the scheduling snafu so I probably didn't do as well as I could have. Over a week later I was informed that they wouldn't be going forward.

I made a general submission on Microsoft's career site. About two months later, a Microsoft recruiter contacted me and asked me some general questions about my background. She then directed me to another recruiter who asked me if I would be interested for a position on the MSN team. I said I was interested, and a few days later, she set up a phone interview with the hiring manager. The phone interview was completely technical. I had to write code in a Live Meeting session. First I was asked to write some very basic HTML and CSS. Then I was asked to code up a problem that was recursive in nature. I struggled a little bit, but was able to come up with a solution in the end. A few days later, my recruiter told me that Microsoft wanted to fly me to Seattle for an on-site interview. A week later, I flew out for a day of interviewing. My interview consisted of three one-hour interviews, and one 1.5-hour interview that included lunch. My first interviewer had me code up a pretty standard problem on the whiteboard. As I coded it up, she asked me questions about what I was doing and how efficient my code was. My final code was not very efficient, but that turned out to be okay as she was just looking to see how I think. She also asked me to describe a time where I solved a hard coding problem on my own. My second interviewer had me design the classes that would be required for a CSS parser that would ultimately try to compress a CSS file by merging redundant selectors. Most of my time was spent designing the basic data structures and explaining how I would go about merging selectors. Again, he was just looking to see how I think. My third interview consisted of a one-hour lunch followed by a half-hour whiteboard coding session. The lunch portion was pretty casual where we mostly talked about what I've worked on in the past. The coding portion was pretty standard. I struggled a bit, but that turned out to be okay. I was told ahead of time that the fourth interview was contingent on how well the first three interviews went. So I was happy when I was told that I would have a fourth interview. The fourth and final interviewer was an old man who was higher up on the ladder. The interview was very laid back. He asked me questions like why I wanted to work at Microsoft, how long I intended to stay, and if I plan to pursue higher education. It was my impression that if you make it to the fourth interview, it's already been decided that you're technically capable of working at Microsoft. Now it was time to see if you had the right personality to work there. Two weeks later, my recruiter called me up with an offer. Overall, very positive experience. Every interviewer was very nice. They all tried to make me feel as comfortable as possible, giving me helpful hints when I started to struggle with a coding problem. They were definitely more interested in how you think than the final code that ends up on the whiteboard. Perfection is not required.

Was contacted by a v- recruiter that found my resume in their system. Had a call with her, and set me up for a call with the hiring manager. Had a tech screen a few days later with him. It was pretty rough, but I faired well enough to get an invitation to Redmond. Flew out a few weeks later and interviewed with 6 different people throughout the day. Everyone was very nice, the offices are gorgeous (Studio West), and the interviews were challenging. They really liked my background, and I had a very positive experience throughout the day. An offer was made a few weeks later and I accepted. The salary was lower than I was anticipating, but the cost of living in Seattle is MUCH lower than San Francisco where I live. I move out there in less than a month.

Initial communication: referred by an employee and got word from a staffing agent that they were looking for a match. Once I was in the system, it took about 2 weeks for me to hear from the interested groups. Phone screen: "Tell me how you would do this" kind of interview questions. All phone interview questions were pertinent to the work that the group did...no oddball questions. After 2 days, I was invited for an onsight interview. On-site interview: I interviewed with two groups. Started at 8am, and it lasted through dinner (taken out by prospective manager) until about 9pm. The interview process was done in famous Microsoft style: the applicant visits various future colleagues in their offices, they ask questions to probe your intelligence, they make a decision, and when handing you off to the next interview, inform that interviewer of what they asked along with their initial impressions. There were no "why are manhole covers round" type of questions. Most were coding questions (boring & don't measure intelligence in my opinion), and there were a few math questions (probability & statistics). I observed that the work environment really depends on the team dynamics. Each group is a little fiefdom that competes with other groups. Of the 2 groups, I had no interest in joining one of them, and was very attracted to the other group. Unfortunately, the group that I wanted to be in deliberated, but decided not to extend an offer. The final process took 2 days. I had initial salary negotiations with the hiring agent: ballpark of 100K salary (I have a PhD) and up to 20K bonus per year...plus the fabulous Microsoft benefits package. In the end, I got a more family friendly (and more lucrative) job elsewhere.

Contacted by a recruiter. Had a preliminary 'skills phone interview' (how long using x technology)... I was honest basically saying 15 years C++, but < 6 on the web and C# front. Was called in for a day interview. I was told I would meet with three people. After my third interview (lunch), I was taken to meet with two other people, then walked to the door. On the surface, the interview was more or less normal. These guys were experienced software developers who were some nice, some grumpy, some arrogrant, some sociable, some not. Normal. They ask me what I'm working on, some questions about my past, then I ask what they're working on, and then each interviewer asked a technical question, it seemed like because they knew they were supposed to because it's microsoft. The questions were hard, but it wasn't as nitpicky as I feared, and after working through the problems I felt like I came to reasonable solutions. But I didn't get an offer, so maybe they didn't feel the same? Honestly several of these problems I would have answered by classifying the algorithm, looking it up on wikipedia and coding. My last interview with the senior staff member was the worst. He didn't seem very interested in my answers. He asked if I wanted to change any of my answers to previous interviewers, as if somehow their were 'right' and 'wrong' answers, I guess. Sticking to who you are and what you do best is the wrong way? He asks if I have any questions, but then provides non answers to the ones I ask, so I say no, I can't think of any. I asked about work life balance and got the distinct impression that I was way out of bounds. Now that I think about it, I don't feel really good about the experience. Between all the emailing between interviews, the trading info, the puzzles, and the trick questions, it seemed more like trying out for a game show than a job. I believe this guys were reducing me to a zero or one (hire/no hire), and their questions were being taylored to make their decision. It was not about trying to understand who I am and what I could bring to the table. So I answer that I prefer references over pointers and I am a no hire? Immature at best. In that regard, a bad experience. Be prepared to be underestimated, under-respected and not seen. After putting it out there for this kind of experience you will inevitably end up feeling like a fool. Why do they use a process like this? One has to wonder about the experience working there if this is the recruitment setup. One guy intimated that they work pretty crazy hours there, so I suspect a big part of the interview was trying to find someone M$ could own. Not me I guess, though the technology was tempting. I would have tried it, I admit. The recruiter was on time with the no offer news (5 days), the best part about the interview (though I did enjoy talking to a couple of the guys). It worked out, I guess.

I had a ridiculous experience. The first time my interview was scheduled the interviewer never called. I panicked and tried to get back to my recruiter but it turned out she was out of office (no auto-responses through her email). I sent multiple emails but received no response. Finally I decided to call. I didn't have her phone number as she never disclosed it. I was able to speak with her by using their automated system and mentioning her name. Another interview was scheduled. This interviewer was strongly biased towards SDE/T positions. He asked me why I applied for an SDE position and not SDE/T. I gave my explanation and was told the same could apply to SDET therefore I should really consider SDE/T. I said ok, but I like SDE (matter of personal choice really). After a lot of chatting about stuff like this we finally arrived at the technical questions. I was asked to return the longest palindrome in a given string. I was barely given 5 minutes (because most of the time was spent in explaining why SDET is kind of better as SDETs focus on code quality rather than just shipping a product). Further few minutes were given to test the code that I wrote. Btw, did I mention that I was supposed to write code in live meeting where there is no way you can edit the text you've typed? No indentation, nothing? (I couldn't figure it out, neither could my interviewer) After this, it took them over a month to reject me. The interviewer said 1-2 weeks. I was expecting so much from this. I wish it would have been different.

Well, first of all I attended a job fair at my college, Arizona State University, where I handed my resume to Microsoft. I was then called in to the school career center for my first interview. I was so nervous but I was able to answer the questions I was asked even though I didn't finish writing the code, he saw my thought process and he agreed that given the time, I could code the solution. A few weeks later, I received an email to set a date for an in-person interview. I arrived in Seattle and went for my interview the next day. On getting to Microsoft, I met some other candidates who were also interviewing that day. We all were in the receiving area playing with the surface, xbox guitar hero and some other games. I had applied for an internship but asked them right there to change it to a job and I was told that I might not get the best fit. Thinking back, I guess I should have stuck with the internship. I met with three people on that day, all about an hour each except the third which was about an hour and half because of the lunch. I was asked some tough questions and I was able to answer some really well, and others not so well. Overall, it was a good interviewing experience but I was so drained at the end of the day.

It started with a referral from a friend. I was contacted by a recruiter and offered a phone interview, which I accepted. The phone interview took place within a week. The phone interviewer seemed to be technically capable of analyzing my answers. The phone interview questions varied between high-level design questions and low-level technical questions. Overall, she was cordial and happy to answer any questions i had. I was contacted within a couple days with an offer for the in-person interview. Apparently, they were trying out a new interview format where they bring in 30 or so candidates at a time, all to be interviewed on the same day. The interviews were still 1:1, but all interviews were conducted simultaneously, and the interviews were conducted at 45 minute intervals, with 15 minute breaks in between. It was a little different, but it allows us to socialize with each other and relax a bit before our next interview. After all interviews were finished, we sat through a couple product presentations, selling us on the products we might be working on. This occurred while the interviewers were making their decisions. We were told that all decisions would be made before we left, which was awesome. After the presentations, I was called out to a separate room along with a small group of other people. We were all given offers; I'm not sure about what happened to the others. I got to meet the manager of the group I was hired for (who also happened to be one of my interviewers), and we talked about various teams that I could choose to work with. All of the recruiters were very nice and happy to help out. All of the interviewers did their best to sell their teams to me. Overall, it was a great experience.

I was interviewing for an SDE position. I felt prepared for my interview. I left completely demoralized. The interviewers were certainly nice, and Microsoft does a great job of making sure that you are comfortable. They paid for the flight, lodging, food, rental car, etc. When I arrived, I spoke w/ an HR representative who seemed distant and unengaged with our conversation. My second interview was odd in the sense that the discussion focused entirely on arcane aspects of SQL and some generic problem solving. That was fine, but then he posed a string interpolation problem on the whiteboard and asked me to write an algorithm... I am a-ok with problem solving, but I am one of the cerebral 'think it out' type of developers. Tossing ideas on a whiteboard isn't how I do things.... and I think the interviewer picked up on this. Ultimately, I came close to solving it, but I was feeling a bit pressured and out of my comfort zone. The third interview was with a very, very senior SDE who proceeded to grill me on c/c++, memory allocation, stack frames, register allocation, etc. While my resume reflected some commercial c/c++ experience, that was over 10 years ago.... since then I have focused almost entirely on java/.net and other languages. More importantly, the position I was interviewing for didn't require any c/c++ experience. The interviewer then chose to present a problem which involved the development of a 'move' algorithm for cribbage. This was another 'whiteboard' problem where given enough time, I could have solved it, but they really, really put the screws to you... and expect you to think on your feet... quickly. The last interview was a 'fluff' interview during lunch, and I could tell that the interviewer was just passing time. Another whiteboard problem followed where I had to develop a base-26 version of itoa(), which was simple enough.... but I messed up on a bit of syntax... The bottom line is that while I was certainly capable of solving any of the problems, the medium/platform they expect you to solve them is totally incompatible with my personal comfort zone. Am I smart enough to work at MS? Absolutely... I have over 20 years of industry experience using a variety of microsoft tools and platforms. I also have a proven track record of architecting, developing and delivering secure, high-volume websites and enterprise systems. This is no BS... I can do the job. However, there is a definite culture clash between MS and I. I have been told that other dev groups at MS are similar with their approach and style... which is why I will not be interviewing there anytime soon :)

He asked some questions about my engineering background and then asked me to code something. The communication medium was Microsoft Live Meeting and I did the code on the screen where he could see it. A couple days after the phone interview, an email arrived inviting me to Redmond for interviews. The day was a long one with 7 interviews in all. 5 of the 7 were technical interviews. One was more informational and the last was asking some behavioral questions. The technical interviews consisted of a coding problem, i.e. how to delete a node from a linked list.

I was interviewed by 7 people overall, from 10am up to 6pm in the evening when I had the final conversation with the recruiter. The interview questions were not too hard, I got some usual questions on linked lists and trees. Other questions were mostly about hardware and low-level drivers. I wasn't asked any puzzles that MS was once famous for, but I got several interesting questions about emulating an old console game on modern hardware and about avoiding issues with problematic hardware.

Microsoft has smart engineers and they want to work with other smart engineers. They mainly test your ability to design clever algorithms on a whiteboard under pressure. When you are writing up your answer the key is to just keep talking, tell them what you are thinking, Even if you don't have the answer yet just keep talking to let them see your process. As long as you can do some basic coding on the whiteboard and show them that you have an actual thought process behind it you should be ok.

The interview process I went through is a bit abnormal, since the project I worked on was being bought into Microsoft. I did not need a phone interview. Instead, I went straight to Redmond along with my other team members for on-site interview. It started from 9 to 5, full day including lunches. Each interviewer had me for an hour, and asking me coding questions, design questions, my past experience (especially how well I know the project that was being bought into Microsoft), and the usual. At the end of the interview I was taken to a person who said if I wasn't hired I wouldn't have met him, so I was very happy. A few days later I got an offer that is pretty decent, and so I took the job.

msft has two rounds. 1st round is usually on-campus. Recruiters usually come to campus multiple times throughout the year. It's always not a big deal if you miss once - because they'll always come back again in a month or so. 1st round is half an hour. Usually 5 min behavioral and the rest is tech. Depends on how fast you are and the actual recruiter, the number of questions being asked could range from 1 to 5. It takes about 1-3 weeks to hear from the recruiter about the result of the 1st round. Then they'll schedule an on-site interview with you. Usually you can choose four dates in the next coming month and they'll finalize one. They'll fly you to seattle (or other location you chose) and take care of all expense (hotel, transporation, meals etc). The on-site interview takes one-full day from around 8:15am to roughly 4pm. The actual length varies depends on your performance. Usually you'll be interviewing with two groups, one in the morning and one in the afternoon and there's a lunch interview in between. You'll meet 2-3 interviewers from each group. If you really screw up your morning interview there could be a chance that your afternoon interviews will be cancelled (they'll tell you your next interviewer is sick or something). You'll get an offer from the group only if all interviewers say yes and if one or more says no you won't get one. So that means you still have two chances (two groups). Each interview is 1on1 (95% of the time taking place in the interviewer's office) and takes about 1 hour. The interview consists of short behaviral questions and majority is about tech questions. You will be writing code on whiteboard. At the end of each interview, the interviewer will bring you to your next interviewer. They will exchange about questions already asked to you and your performance. If you make your way to see the dev manager in the end - the last interviewer, that means you are doing a decent job. If you don't even get to see the manager that means 99% likely you are already out. In the past it usually takes about 1 week after your on-site interview to hear about the result (could be longer if you don't get an offer). But now they expedite that to immediate result - you'll be asked to return to building 19 (it was optional in the past). And if your recruiter wants to see you that means you'll be hearing about an offer. And if you are told you can leave and wait for result, that possibly indicates a negative answer. Now they are experimenting new interview process which is more similar to Cisco's, which consists of 4 interviews which only take half a day, plus some site-seeing and presentations. The compensation is 80k (Software Development Engineer @ 89) base plus up to 20% bonus (realistically, less than 10%) plus stock options. Standard benefits - 401k, free insurance (health, dental, vision), ESPP and other misc stuff. It's lower b/c cost of living is a lot cheaper than bay area and the tax is a lot lower too. Relocation is 5k. You have 2 weeks to accept or decline the offer.

First I submitted my resume to the recruiter. Then I was selected for a first interview round, with an engineer. I had to solve a programming exercise. I could chose the programming language. I was asked also several questions about my background. Then I was chosen for the final round. In this round I performed 4 interviews with different engineers from different deparments. In each interview I had to solve a programming task, on paper, or work through a testing and diagnostic scenario. Also I was asked questions about my interests, expertise and background. The programming tasks were about graphs, searching, string processing. In general the interviewers were nice and kind. At the end I was asked if I was willing to work in the Office team, but since I like software projects with hardware involved, I said it would be OK, but I'd rather be involved in the Xbox or Windows Phone teams. I think that cost me the offer, but the experience was good in general.

It was a full-day process, I had one person responsible for me whom I'd meet in the morning, at lunch and for the final questions at the end of the day. The rest of the day was spent going from office to office, interviewing with (mostly) developers and project managers, spending an hour with each. The questions were predominantly technical, ranging from puzzlers to pieces of code the interviewer was currently working on.

Here I had to implement a sorted 2-D linked list (the first node of the linked list is connected to another linked list and it continues this way, and each row i.e. single linked list can have at most 5 nodes, and the keys stored in linked list are in sorted order). Along with representation write the add and delete function for this linked list. (Note: No pseudo code business there, had to write proper code). Finally he asked me how to test the code (basically wanted different test-cases to cover the whole code and its boundary cases).   Answer Question

Interview Round 1: Here I had to implement a sorted 2-D linked list (the first node of the linked list is connected to another linked list and it continues this way, and each row i.e. single linked list can have at most 5 nodes, and the keys stored in linked list are in sorted order). Along with representation write the add and delete function for this linked list. (Note: No pseudo code business there, had to write proper code). Finally he asked me how to test the code (basically wanted different test-cases to cover the whole code and its boundary cases). Interview Round 2: 1) In an image clouds are scattered all over. Lets say clouds are of white color and the rest of the image has different color. The problem was to count the number of such clouds. (Assume the image is given in a 2D matrix format). 2)Given an array find all the sub-arrays that has sum zero. (Note: an nlogn solution is required). A continuation of the above question was to find all subarrays with sum less than a small number lets say 1. Interview Round 3: In this round I was asked about my projects, BTP, interests and had to answer questions like – “why microsoft” or “what do you like about it” etc. After that he asked few aptitude-type questions, like- 1)Given two dice how would you represent all the days of a month? 2)How would you design an automated traffic-signal system? 3)What are the measures that you would devise to allow credit cards for children?

I applied through Microsoft's web-site, got a phone call telling me about the process. First interview- Technical: great atmosphere, after I introduced myself and heard about the position I was asked few questions: 1) find the first node where 2 linked lists are merging into O(n) (has no circles). answer: run 2 times on each list to find sizes, the bigger minus the smaller gives you the difference, on the longer list go the difference and then move them both in sync until they are equal. 2) print and transfer BST between 2 computers answer: use delimiter and print in order, read the file node then left child, every time you see delimiter go up 1 level print right child and then all of his left childs. 3) write code for ATM system, then what happens when you have 2 ATMs at the same time (sync with locks). second interview- Technical: again after I told about myself and heard more about the position, i was asked to go on the white board and design code for Domino game system. created the classes on board, main methods and was asked to actually implement few methods. Third interview- HR: Was very easy and ordinary, why you want to work for Microsoft, what are you looking for, what would your current manager tell about you and blah blah... Forth interview- AA interview: Failed here. it is the last step before you get a proposal. Again we started with me telling about myself, former projects I did in my current job (i couldn't tell much because of confidential information). we talked about a project I did during my degree. for unknown reason he started to ask me wired questions like how much memory is integer, i said (2^32-1) so he asked me how much is int[3000][3000] in memory. i wrote down the equation so he asked me to transfer it to MB's, and i didn't remember the exact numbers since i started to feel a bad feeling about this. then he asked me to give him a run time of merge sort (which i remembered is O(nlogn)) but he seems not to be thrilled about it. 4 days later i got a call that told me that i am not fit for this position, it really felt like it was personal, but there was not much that i could do about it.

I got referred to Microsoft from a friend somewhere in August. In October, i got contacted by a recruiter inviting me to *officially* apply on their website. A couple of weeks later, i got contacted by another recruiter, telling me that they have reviewed my application and that i will be offered a 30-minutes non-technical phone-interview *to assess my background*. On the day of the interview, i got contacted by two different recruiters, one who spotted me on Linkedin and inviting me to *officially* apply on their website and another one telling me they have selected me for an on-site 30-minutes campus interview. Which was pretty confusing ... Okay, so i replied to them both, telling them i *already have an interview in like 30 minutes* and it's non-technical. The recruiter from Linkedin replied that i should be aware that *it is technical*, i will write code ! ... Which was confusing again. Finally, someone from the US called me and asked me a bunch of semi-technical questions, which i don't really know what tested. They varied from "when does your passport expire?" to "how would you explain recursion to a 5-year old?". I was also given the classical 9-stones-2-weighing problem and asked what is the difference between C and Java ... There were also some questions from my resume ("what did you find most challenging about ... ?") and stuff like this. I got contacted back in 2 weeks and they rejected me ... not sure why. Maybe due to my lack of explaining recursion to a 5-year old.

First there was a Skype interview with questions about what have you worked on before and some about testing, for example how would you test a pencil. After that they invite you to interview and pay you the trip. There are 3-4 interviews. You can get an offer after 3 and after 4, or you can get rejected after 3 and after 4. 4th interview is just if they think they need one more interview to make a decision. Interviews last for 45min and have around 10min break in between. The questions depends on who interviews you, but in general almost all of them ask how would you test something. The algorithmic questions are some basic algorithms. You can of course use any programming language, but the ones with object oriented paradigm are recommended. The correct names of the methods and parameters are not that important.

I was expecting hard questions, but the questions were simple basic algorithm and data structures.   Answer Question

THIS IS FOR THE SUMMER INTERNSHIP The preliminary round was held online in select colleges and we were called for an onsite interview. Those with good thinking approach were also chosen and not solely based on getting the solution. There was also a coding round for those with lesser score in the online round. A simple problem was given to many students and we were expected to solve it. If the approach was deeply flawed, the person would be eliminated. The next round was a technical round where a 1-1 interview with a Microsoft employee was held. The duration was about an hour and was quite strenuous. Following the round, the HR manager will let you know the feedback and tell you the results. The HR manager was very encouraging and asked the eliminated candidates to reapply after working their skills. This feedback really made a very positive impact on me. The final round would be a HR round I guess(I could not crack the technical round).

This interview process was at Mexico, applying for an SDE position at Redmond. I went to a college recruiting and a screening technical problem was applied. Once I finished, they asked me to explain the solution and any test cases I would apply. They set me up for an interview in-campus. The interview consisted of asking me about personal and school projects, and any prior experience that may show passion for technology. Two technical questions were asked (receive two strings and print unique characters in order, implement atoi). At the end the interviewer told me to wait up to 3 weeks. I got contacted about a week later, setting up details for an interview at Mexico City. They told me I would be interviewing with 3 to 4 persons. The interview was about a month later. Microsoft paid for my travel expenses to Mexico City. There, I had 3 interviews, each with a different team. I was told I would not be interviewing for a particular team or position, but being interviewed by different teams gave them a good insight. Each interview is about 45-50 minutes 1. The first interviewer gave a few minutes to ask about previous projects. He told me he was in the Embedded Windows team. He then asked 2 technical questions (telephone keypad and angle between minute and hour hand in a clock), and a brain teaser. He seemed interested in knowing my thinking process, rather than the actual solution. 2. The second interviewer first focused more on behavioral questions and some past experience. He told me he was in the Operating Systems group, focused in security. He seemed as if it was an interview recipe for him, as he would not allow to talk about anything else. The questions were the next: - What has been the most challenging technical issue you have faced? - Tell me about a Microsoft product you like. Why? How has it been useful to you? - Tell me about a Microsoft product you don't like. Why? What would you have done differently, if you were part of the dev team for that product? Then he asked two technical questions (show odd numbers from 1 to N, function that swaps variables). This interviewer did not allow any question during the technical question. He was definitely not interested and what I thought while solving the problem, and did not want other solutions but his. H 3. My third interview was the longest, as we had a long conversation. He was in the Windows Update team, in charge of reviewing and fixing upon feedback provided, and deployment. He first asked my most challenging technical issue, as my answer was similar to the first one he asked me about another one. Interviewers share notes between them, so they don't ask you the same stuff. He also asked me what had I accomplished at my job that I was proud of. After some chit-chat on SQL and databases, he asked a technical question (Fibonacci with index).

A string is received, which contains from 0 to N numbers. Print all the possible combination of valid words, mapping each number in the string to a character in the telephone keypad. Assume no 0 or 1's are provided, as they do not have characters in it. A function bool isValid(string) is provided, so you may know whether a word is considered valid.   1 Answer Write a function which will receive an hour and minute from an analog clock, and calculate the inner angle between them.   1 Answer Write a for loop, which prints the odd numbers from 0 to N.   1 Answer Write a function that receives two pointers, and swaps the values between them.   1 Answer Implement a function that returns (or prints) a Fibonacci sequence. The function will receive two integers, an index (idx) and the number of results (N). The function should return the Fibonacci sequence starting from the idx and up to N results. Example: The Fibonacci sequence is as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... The sequence is supposed to be viewed as an array, so if index 6 was provided, calculations should start from number 8. Suppose index 3 is provided and 3 results must be returned. The result should be: 2, 3, 5.   Answer Question

I applied through campus recruiting. In campus they asked a question about how to convert a double number into a String, 2 weeks later I received an invitation for the second round in Guanajuato, Guanajuato. In this round I was asked how to get the maximum and minimum of an IPv4 address, I believe i answered correctly but I might have skipped a few details (on late sept). The week after that I received an email telling me to wait for results with a message saying that they were not sure about these results and that the recruiter would have a meeting with my interviewer to decide wether to keep me or not (last time I applied I received one saying that they were soon to reach its peak recruiting volume, which makes me think they still interview people in other regions of LATAM and make you wait until they have "x" number of "good" candidates to which they do a "SELECT TOP 30 * order by "unkown parameters"), it also said that final results would be ready by Oct 24, I didn't receive any notice from them until I asked after such date, they decided to end the interviews for that year, even though the recruiter was a very nice person, I didn't like the fact that they forgot to notify me.

The process was quite simple. I had applied through college placement department. Initial round was aptitude, this was an online round.Those who cleared this round were intimated about the second round which was online coding round consisting of two questions which were quite simple. Those who cleared this were shortlisted for third round which was a written coding round,consisted of one simple question. They were not concerned if you could solve the problem but were curious to see as to what logic was a person using. Some candidates from the second round were directly sent to the fourth round. The fourth and fifth rounds were technical interview. All rounds were elimination rounds. Last was the HR round.

After sending an email to the HR manager I received a screening form with questions about your personality and experience and then 4 programming assignments where 2 of them had to be solved. Upon successfully completing the screening I was invited to come to the Microsoft Campus where I was to spend 5 hours being interviewed by 4 interviewers. 3 of the interviews all had a short talk about myself and I could ask about them (the interviewers were Microsoft engineers themselves) and then they had a code problem that they asked me to solve. So each interview had a focus area and for me the areas were: algorithms and data structures, testing, and general software architecture. The last interview was with the manager about how good a fit I was with the company and was more about my personality and how I handled different situations.

Phone interview was a simple background info about my previous experiences as well as my academic background. After that, I was to meet him on campus for a 1 on 1 interview. Very rigorous interview, with brutal dynamic programming questions. Which you have to write your program on a piece of paper. The interviewer asks you to speak your mind while writing your program so that he knows 1) that I have multitask, 2) and what im thinking of doing. At the end, i did not do so well. He actually gave me advise on what i should be focusing and what i did wrong. He even asked if this is my first big-company interview. lol.. yes it was.

The guy who called me wasn't a developer, someone from HR. He was asking questions about my past experience, previous job-related questions, one puzzle and other questions about most used programming languages, my favorite software, what I would like to improve. The puzzle was about nine pieces of marble. They're all equal, except one which is heavier than others. You have balanced weights and you have to find the heaviest one by weighting only twice. I'd encountered this problem before and solved it, so during the interview, I guess I solved too quickly.

The guy was quite likeable and friendly, but it was strange for me that he didn't want to know any particular technical details regarding my experience, so I actually didn't know what to tell him then.   Answer Question

The process from sending the CV to the first interview took ~1 month. HRs had not responded for a long time. Then they arranged a phone interview with a senior developer from MS. The interview was quite brief. He asked a couple of general questions like 'what is your software development background?' 'what are you working on now?'. Then we came directly to programming. There was only one problem: determine whether two strings are anagrams, i.e. contain the same letters.

Phone interview was behavioral, but you get to be asked to provide some hacks mostly on tricky algorithmic questions at on-campus meetings.

As to my understanding you have to give (or at least on the way) decent answers in all of your interviews, even one recruiter hesitates then they look for someone else.

My first interview was a brief phone screening which was just about me and my projects. I was then invited to join an online group meeting on Microsoft Lync which is similar to Skype, during which a member of HR spoke to all candidates. They discussed the next interview process and answered any questions asked by the candidates (there were about 35 candidates). A date and time was allocated by follow-up email for each of us to attend the interview in the Sydney Office. On my interview day, there was a total of 5 interviewers (all senior members of the Microsoft team), and 5 interviewees. We each received 3-4, 1on1 interviews in separate rooms, rotating between the interviewers. A decision may be made after 3 interviews or you may be given a final 4th interview if needed. I went through a total of 4 interviews, 45 minutes each with 15 minute break in-between. The breaks were spent with the other candidates and a member of the HR who discussed about Microsoft’s work and workplace. The interviews generally went like so: First 5-15 minutes: • The interviewer introduces themselves and their job. • Asks about you, your projects and your past work (basically your resume). Next 25-35 minutes: • Interviewer gives you 1-2 problems, you are to provide your implementation on the white board. • Interviewer asks you to give test cases to your implementation. Final 5 minutes: • Any questions you may have for the interviewer. My Interview Questions: 1. Write a function to determine if a string is a Palindrome 2. a. Give a list of expected functionality for the “Linked List” data structure b. Write a function to reverse a Linked List 3. a. Write a function to determine if a number is prime. b. Write a function to reverse an integer (i.e. 123 = 321), with O(1) space complexity. c. Write a function to round a float to the nearest integer (i.e. 3.14 = 3, 3.56 = 4). 4. Write a function to print all paths of a binary tree to a certain depth/length. Example, Input: The following binary tree, searching to a depth of 3 5 / \ 3 7 / \ / \ 1 2 5 8 Output: 5-3-1 5-3-2 5-7-5 5-7-8

After, I was bombarded by a plethora of technical questions. Here are a few of them: What are differences between Java and C? Why would someone use Java over C/C++ and vice-versa? What's inheritance? What's a virtual function? What's the JVM? What's a disadvantage of the JVM ? What's the difference between an array and linkedlist? After this I was asked one coding question: Reverse a singly linked-list with and without using an auxiliary data structure.

I was interviewed as an intern for 30 minutes and was asked about my education history and 2 algorithm questions. The interview was scheduled by my recruitment helpers at the University of British Columbia, Canada. A cover letter and resume were submitted for when I applied to Microsoft. Prior to the interview, you are asked to fill out a form about what domains interest you and what type of position you would prefer (program manager, software development engineer, software development engineer in test). After my internship was over, they offered me a full time position. No further interview was required. I seem to be an exception to the usual case in which a full day interview process is normally required.

I got an on-site interview in Dublin for SDE and SDET internship position. I was invited to this interview after a short interview at my university. I had 3 interviews with 1 SDE team (2 guys) ,1 SDET team (another 2 guys) and 1 Project manager. I got a lot of questions related to: Why do I want to work for Microsoft? Why am I pursuing Computer Science? What am I looking for in technology? They asked me about a recent article I read on Techcrunch. Coding questions were easy: - count the binary 1 digits in a number - given two nodes in a binary tree return their Lowest Common Ancestor - given two strings say if they are anagrams I also had Testing questions before every coding question on how would I test a method that does the code.

At the third interview I was asked which one of the previous interviews I liked better and why?   Answer Question You have a project and you want to release it in multiple languages. For every language you have a resource file which contains hotkeys of every Module. For example: one module is File which has Find with hotkey F and Free with hotkey F and another module Edit which has Replace with hotkey R. For every module you want to find the colliding Hotkeys. In our example in module File: Find and Free have colliding hotkey "F". In the resource file a hotkey is coded as: \alpha"F"Find.Files; where \alpha is one character: alpha. You have 100 languages and around 6000 hotkeys in a resource file. Determine all the colliding hotkeys.   1 Answer

When I applied to them, it turned out they were planning to have a campus recruiting event in my city (Moscow) within next 2 weeks, though unfortunately I was on a trip at that time so couldn't make it. Thus they made one phone interview (with a recruiter) and invited me to a recruiting event in Kiev six weeks later. There they had two groups of interviewees coming at different times, each group consisting of 6 people. Every person would undergo 3 or 4 interviews (each 45-minutes long). After every interview interviewers exchange some feedback and you listen to the HR guy who promotes Seattle as a place to live. After that you go to another interview. After 3 interviews they analyse the feedback and decide who stays for another interview. If you aren't invited to the fourth interview, that doesn't mean you wouldn't get an offer. I personally got an offer after only 3. The questions vary in difficulty depending on your interviewer, but overall I found them harder than in other major companies (Google, Facebook). As usually, if you have ever participated in programming competitions, you have better chances of solving their problems.

I don't think I can disclose the exact question, but one of the interviewers actually asked two questions, one of then being some kind of "real world" open-ended one, and another one seemed to be algorithmic, the problem was that there was no solution, and even the interviewer had some ideas about it but not the complete solution.   1 Answer

Found the interview process quite slow, with infrequent communication from recruiters. Did not enjoy my on-campus interviewer, and think he pegged me wrong in the questions he asked. Also, allotted time for interview (25 minutes) was far, far too short to develop any meaningful picture of a candidate (me, or anyone else). I have not pursued Microsoft further as a result, and instead received offers from other major tech companies (Amazon, Google, etc).

No questions were particularly difficult or unexpected. Microsoft helped pioneer the now-standard "logic questions and code" interviews the top tech companies have generally adopted, and they still interview that way.   Answer Question

I went to an on-campus interview with a Microsoft employee, who was not human resources but was a software engineer and tested me out on minor programming tasks and asked me questions about my experience. There weren't any trick questions and the interview was very conversational and not as intimidating as others.

The most difficult question was simply: name an issue and how you resolved it. I was prepared for any programming question they could throw at me, but this one was more difficult.

Applied online to the company's site for college grads. Was selected by recruiter and scheduled for a 45 min interview on campus with a Microsoft Developer. This first interview went well so they scheduled interviews at the company headquarters in Seattle. The recruiter asked me what my preferences were for the teams I'd like to work with, along with how I felt about relocating to Seattle. The company takes care of travel and lodging, they put you in a hotel and you get up to $75 a day for meals at the hotel. $75 is more than plenty for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The company also reimburses costs for rentals or taxis, after the day long onsite interviews they gave out 3 taxi vouchers to go visit downtown Seattle. On the interview day, you first meet with your recruiter, they will then direct you to the first person you interview with. At Microsoft, each developer has an office, so you meet with them at their office, and the interview is conducted there. Each interviewer then takes you to the next interviewer, and *they talk to each other* before your interview begins. Any weaknesses or flaws are exchanged I believe. I went through 5 interviews. I also had lunch with one of my interviewer.

Just had the phone interview so no idea on the outcome yet. The interviewer was very friendly and knowledgeable and offered plenty of opportunities to ask questions about the company, the position and so on. We then talked about my resume and what projects I'd worked on. He asked me about my most technically challenging project and the various issues I encountered as well as how I solved them in detail. He then asked a brain teaser / algorithm type question which took a little coaching for me to get right. I'd revised quite hard on data structures and algorithms but found myself rather unprepared for the question. I didn't get the perfect answer but made sure to keep talking and offering up suggestions. This led to me being asked other questions which I could answer easily. Overall, it was a friendly interview but I'm 50/50 on if I'll get a call back.

We didn't talk much about my resume, but at first he gave me a hard problem - how many 0s are there in 100 ! - (he himself said it was quite difficult) and his reason was that I said in my resume that I had won an award in math in my high school. And i failed to solve it. He gave me another one - write a function to provide all the permutations of an array - which should be easy to solve, but I failed, maybe because I wasn't recovered from the first failure.

An initial university interview with a campus recruiter went well and left a positive impression. The interview consisted of some string manipulation questions, substring searching... standard stuff. The recruiter was engaging and had a lot of good answers to my questions. After that, I was invited out to Redmond for interviews, and that is where things were a bit off. I was scheduled for the afternoon interviews, with my latest interview being around 5:00. Being from the eastern side of the US, this was quite late for me and I was very sleepy by the end of it. We were told we would be given lunch before our interviews, but no lunch was given leaving those of us who had not eaten fairly hungry. I also found out I was being interviewed for the wrong position due to a clerical error. All of my interviewers (there were 4) except for one were rushed and had little to no time for questions from me at all. They had been doing interviews all day and did not really seem to care or want to speak with me about anything but their technical questions so that they could move on to the next candidate. Each of the 4 interviews consisted of a few questions about previous projects followed by a technical question that took almost the whole interview time-slot to implement before I was tossed off to another interviewer. Due to jet lag and the late interview times, my later interviews did not go too well and I was quite burned out by the end of it. They had a fun lobby with a MS Surface, Guitar Hero and other entertainment, but the people just seemed cold and uncaring compared to other companies with whom I had interviewed in the past.

Microsoft came to my uni a while ago to find new some recruits. They promised pizza and a chance to win an Xbox if we went to their seminar so I decided to go check it out. They were true to their word about the pizza -- and I gotta say that there was an awful lot of it -- but it turned out that you needed to hand in your resume if you wanted the Xbox! I had to run to a computer to print one out! Anyway, I didn't expect to get a response (my resume's pretty bad) so imagine my surprise when I got an e-mail from them a few weeks later asking me to come in for an interview! My interview was broken up into two parts -- a discussion about my interests and experience and the "fun" part that involved applying my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. The first part involved answering a bunch of questions about me and my interests. It was all the usual things you get in a typical interview, e.g. when did I first become interested in software development, what things have I've worked on... The lady was pretty nice and smiled the whole time so I don't know if my responses were the right ones or not. The skills test was actually easier than I thought it would be. I was ushered into a room with a reasonably friendly guy and he handed me a pen, some paper and a sheet of questions. Over the course of the test, I was told to answer three of them. They were actually things people could've solved given enough time. Unfortunately, it turns out that I don't do well under time pressure and I croaked as a result. When it was over, he thanked me and led me to the door. He said a couple of positive things about me and we went our separate ways. I'm a bit disappointed at myself for messing up. However, it was a good learning experience and I at least got a free Xbox for my troubles.

Submitted resume through my university and got invited to interview on-campus two weeks later. The person in the career fair was very nice and helpful. One day before the interview, the two persons from Microsoft held an event for all the candidates. Very few questions were asked by the candidates as the two interviewers spent a lot of time talking about the company. The day of the interview, the interviewer was nice for about 2 minutes. After that, he started behaving very disinterested and spent more time looking at his laptop screen than listening to what I had to say. His behavior made me very nervous, and plenty of times he interrupted to give me hints that I didn't need. Any pause for a few seconds would result in a comment along the lines of "You aren't doing what I asked." Two weeks after the interview I received an e-mail to tell me I didn't make it to the 2nd round. My overall impression is that unless you can code recursive algorithms in less than five minutes, you shouldn't apply at Microsoft. Also to potential candidates don't forget to prepare for behavioral questions.

Glass door limits the no. of characters i use.so im gonna get straight to business! Interview day: Interview 1: Initially scheduled for three interviews, first beginning at 10.30 AM 21st Feb, 2011. My interviewer decided not to show up for the day so i spent about 45 mins waiting in the lobby .At 11.15 this other guy working on the same team as the guy who was initially supposed to interview me came and took me to his office.,.. We generally started interviewing here and he asked some of my project related questions..No code here. Interview 2: My lunch interview was with this really young chap..we ate..taked generally..After lunch we walked back to his office... BAM! gives a marker pen in my hand... n acts as if he doesnt know me at all.. says How would you implement a program which would return a copy of a linked list given the head pointer of the original linked list.(Im giving away my questions coz i did not sign any NDA!).. talked it out quite a bit..developed logic from scratch, wrote pseudo-code, checked-double checked boundary conditions... got the logic approved.. said there are 2 ways to do it.iterative and recursive.. he asked which would you prefer when and why? I explained takin into consideration space, time, situation where the algo would actually be used and so on...he was happy with it.and then i coded it..done!. then he suggested another variant where every node of the linked list had a random pointer (in addition to the next pointer) which could randomly point to another node or be NULL..how would you duplicate such a linked list???? This was a little tricky...but doable..i got it right..everything went off fine.. he then takes me to the next interviewer. Interview 3: Again a young chap..asked a quick question about a past project. n then went straight to the white board... explaned in 3-4 sentences what BFS is.n then said..given a BST..how would you implement a variant of BFS wherein you print the first node... then the nodes in the next level from right to left.then the nodes in the next level from left to right..n the next from right to left and so on.. he asked me to give him data structures and the algo...quite tricky.neva saw this qs before.got stuck a lil..but he hinted me at very specific points...n i was quick to pick up on it.. i figured it out eventually..it can be done using 2 stacks.. I liked this question..then he says i have 15 mins left.n he throws another problem at me.asks me to strategize and code the following problem... usually in linked lists. whenever you create a node.you dynamically allocate some memory and attach a node..but what if you were given some preallocated amount of memory.. in an array..and each element of your array would have a pointer to a node of a linked list. how would you insert into an linked list in this case???..think about it..interesting question..I solved it.but dint have time to code it Interview 4: Really old chap..very very very experienced.. Principal Development Lead for UI in Windows 7... .he asks me about this one project i did in grad school..its was a computer vision project..i explained it on the white board..n in a way i was glad he asked that question since that was one of ma favourite projects and i did reall well in it...he liked what i said.,.. then he draws this on the board: algorithms--API--User experience.. n talks about how API's kinda join work going on in both ends.. n says there are jobs in all three fields..if given a choice..which would you prefer i said more towards the left side of the line.. n he made a note of it... then we again sat back and started talkin bout a lot of stuff..went of pretty ok.. n finally he asked me a design question.how would you implement a linked list class.. simple question..but im kinda weak in the my class design concepts having working mostly in c... but i took sum help from him and figured it out.. he was ok with it..after a while he said im done.for the day. I get back to my room at the marriott.. heavily retrospecting... i felt i performed brilliantly through the day.. trust me guys..im not being conceited here... i really felt i did well.n i cudin think of a single place where i made a crucial mistake or anythin... i did take help in a couple of occasions.. but im guessing they don hold that against you.. 2 days later my recruiter calls and says that they usually give out rejects by email.but he called me to give the news coz my decision was a tough one to make n it was real close... which i din feel was a consolation at all... i asked him for one.jus one reason/hint wateva..off/on the record...i don care...but he said its company policy not to give out feedback..... was dead disappointed with it.... took me a while to get over it,,...

Got an interview thru a referral. 20-30 mins telephone interview. There was an online assessment test of about 1.5 hours prior to the interview. Type of questions: Behavioral, technical (but, very high level view and no coding as such), knowledge about the position and products Advice: It's a very short interview. So, keep your answers brief and get to the point. I wasn't asked if I had any questions and was told that they would get back to me in 1-2 weeks. They sent me an email the very next day and told me that they weren't interested in going forward with me.

The difficult part was the time duration of the interview. Since it was supposed to last about 20 minutes, I shouldn’t have tried to explain my answers like in a behavioral interview. I should have gotten to the point by giving brief answers.   Answer Question

I took a phone interview with Microsoft and they ask me several questions during my phone interview. However, I think the most important question from MS might be 'Why do you apply at MS?'

The online technical assessment contained a lot of questions related to 'Testing'. Also, in the phone interview, I talked about my previous projects, challenging project and what defines a good software. In addition, I had a question about how I will test an application related to Shapes and Triangles. Overall, I felt that I was being interviewed for a Testing position.

I submitted my resume at a career fair at my school for a summer internship at Microsoft and was later contacted for a 30 min on-campus interview. I was asked to solve problems on arrays and to talk about my accomplishments listed on my resume. A month later, I was invited for an on-site interview in Seattle. There were three technical interviews so it involved preparing a lot and practicing algorithms. I was asked questions on binary trees, linked lists and arrays. The recruiters were friendly, the interviewers were not intimidating but I was very nervous. Two weeks later I received an email saying that I was not going to be offered a job. The questions were not difficult but I'd say I needed more practice and to make use of better resources.

I submitted my resume to a recruiter in a college career fair. 3 days later I received an email about on-campus interview. The on-campus interview took place after 2 weeks and consisted of a 1:1 interview with a technical manager from Windows Media Player Testing team. He was nice and everything. First half of the interview consisted of general questions about my projects and what I was working on. The second part was technical and he asked me a really simple question: Calculate factorial recursively. I coded on a piece of paper and spoke out loud the steps. And also wrote the special case checks and stuff. Then he asked the test cases and I gave the test cases(-ve numbers, characters,etc). Then he asked the complexity of the algorithm, where I stumbled a bit. But he helped me in that and we came up with the answer O(n). After that, I didn't hear from Microsoft in 3-4 weeks. I sent an email to the recruiter after 2 weeks without reply. On the 4th week, I was anxious, as I had an onsite interview with another company and emailed again. I got a reply that I was rejected :(

Was given only half an hour to describe my hardest programming project, what my favorite piece of software was and how I would improve it, to describe how I would design a GPS system for hardcore hikers/backpackers differently from a system for casual campers/hikers (something that stumped me, because I have never used a GPS before for these activities and did not know how to answer, and the interviewer was not very helpful in explaining why the groups have different needs), and to describe how I would test a program. Felt very rushed compared to other interviews I've had, and as a result it probably impacted my ability to answer satisfactorily (though it is hard to tell what they were looking for).

Had one short interview on campus, then after 3 months got a phone call for the interview on phone plus had to fill out a pretty boring/long form asking me about my interesting projects etc. First interview was easy; mostly HR stuff, then they sent me a online test, two questions first was to implement FIFO using LIFO second was on the lines of selecting random nodes from a tree. 2nd question was pretty tough. But I did both of them in 1 hour, compiled and send them the working code. Then they called up for a technical interview asking following questions -How would you test an application that takes 3 inputs and draws a triangle? (black box testing) -Write a data structure class that works as both a Stack and a Queue. Write test cases for them. -Write code to reverse a linked list. Write test cases. -Write code to merge-sort 2 linked lists (no duplicates). Write test cases. -Write code to delete all nodes in a linked list that contain integer values that are odd numbers. Write test cases. -Write code to delete alternate nodes in a doubly linked list. Write test cases. - Given "ABC/EF" where do you place values G, H, and I. (pattern matching puzzle). -How will you write a function to merge two sorted arrays assuming one of them have enough space to hold all the members. After this they called me up to MS’s EU headquarters in Ireland, pretty basic interview, back to back 5 interviews, all pretty easy, asking questions about C++ internals, pointers and few simple algorithms, search a list, sort an array, overloading etc. After this (i.e. after about 10 interviews in total and 1 coding test) they precede with an offer the next day, which was sadly only €30K amazingly a very low offer from such a big company. I discussed with the Microsoft’s HR abut the growth prospects what will be my pay after 1 year and then 2 year, turned out its pretty basic, 36-37K after first year and 40-42K after 2nd. I also applied at Accenture; they offered 42K + benefits straight away. So I can’t believe it, but I had to ditch Microsoft and join Accenture. In the end I felt that Microsoft wasted so much of my time, not worth apply a job here. My advice is if you are smart and can make it, join Google. Otherwise go for the money, there is no prestige in working for MS anymore.

Got the interview from speaking with an engineer at a university career fair. During the interview, I was asked about my undergraduate courses. He asked what my favorite class was. I've heard from other students that they've also been asked the same question. The interviewer went over the different available positions they were hiring for, and he went through a quick form about which positions I would be interested in. After some general background and interest questions, he asked me to solve a coding problem on a white board. I personally found the setup pretty intimidating with the interviewer staring at the back of my head, but the question wasn't too bad. The question was as follows: Given two strings, how would you remove from the first string all the characters which appear in the second string. I thought I did decently well and the interviewer seemed satisfied. Overall, the interview was so-so, but not extraordinary.

The process consisted of: attending a tech session, where the resume was submitted to the recruiter; the recruiter requesting a copy of the resume by email and providing some forms to fill in; and the actual interview on school facilities with a Microsoft engineer, who was not at all familiar with the area I would like to have been considered for (I am interested in operating systems).

Had a 30 mins 1:1 interview at my University campus. I asked about my work experience and project then had to write code on paper (Linked list related). After a few days I got a call back to go in for an interview at Microsoft campus in Redmond. The interview took the whole day. I was interviewed by different Software Engineers. I was asked questions related to data structures and algorithms, sw design and IQ questions.

I had worked as SDE intern for 6 months. To get the internship, I had a written technical round and 2 rounds of interviews. After the end of internship, I got what are known as Pre-Placement Interviews. There were a couple of them, 1st with a Lead and 2nd with a Director. In the 1st interview, I was asked a Data Structures problem, 2 small coding tasks and an interesting puzzle. In the 2nd interview, I was asked a coding problem based on Linked List (which I had done somewhere before) and a lot of HR/fit questions.

Got the email from HR said I was referred by an employee and arranged a phone interview with me. Just a few simple questions, why do you want to come to microsoft etc.? Then she arranged another phone interview with one of their engineers, he asked several questions related to my resume and the projects I've worked on. Finally we set up a shared board and he asked several simple algorithms problems and ask me to write the code directly on the shared board (he can see what I type instantly). After the phone interview, I got the on-site interview invitation in 2 days. And I did a 5 round 1:1 personal interview. There're various kinds questions, most of them are algorithm problems.

Typical interview process at Microsoft Ireland is the following: - CV screening / filtering (my guess is that 90% of applications are rejected at this stage) - coding puzzle (solution to be sent in 1 hour) - initial phone screen (HR + simple technical questions) - 1 or 2 technical phone interviews (engineers) - on site interview Somehow I didn't have to do the first coding puzzle. Likely it was because I was recommended by other Microsoft employee (based in US), so they assumed that I am applying for the job in US. When clarified, they passed my CV to Irish recruiters which moved me directly to phone screening. Probably it's the best to get recommended, so you can skip some initial filters. Phone screens were quite typical: - short technical questions covering OOP, programming languages, databases, networks (5-10 mins) - design question (15 mins) - coding question (typically related to the design from previous step - 20 mins) - discussion of coding solution (how to improve it, how to test it, what are the test methodologies - 10 mins) - Q&A (now you can ask questions) On site interview consisted of four 1:1 interviews (45 mins each + 15 min break) with multiple engineers. Some focus on design skills, some on coding (on the whiteboard), some on testing. Everybody asks some short random questions about algorithms, data structures, programming languages, network protocols etc. The last hour (only 2 out of 10 people got there when I was interviewed) was with a director of the department to which I was applying. It was really hard! I was asked about network protocols, data structures, got an algorithmic problem to solve (similar to "egg dropping problem"), where I had to figure out the optimal (not any!) algorithm and provide a formal mathematics proof of it's complexity (big O notation).

The last 1 hour interview on site was the most difficult (described in the interview process above).   Answer Question

Got the interview through Campus Selection. There was a first round of shortlisting based on resumes, followed by written test. Followed by 1 telephonic and 4 rounds of face to face technical itnerviews.

Most difficult or rather interesting discussion was around my final semester project in college. It was a design question which led to the discussion to my project. Something related to fixed size buffers for holding data and buffer management algorithms   Answer Question

Usually, a normal interview process (through university) goes through the following process: career fair -> on campus interview -> on site / phone interview -> offer. My interview was strange, in the sense that I had to do two phone interviews without being offered an on campus interview. One interviewer requested that I also install a program, so that everything I type on my computer can be seen from his side, and asked me to write a program during a phone interview.

There is a disk on a turn table. Half of it is black, and the other half is white. It is rotating in constant speed, but it's rotating fast so that you can't see whether it's going clockwise or counterclockwise. You also have a set of stationary sensors you can install anywhere which can tell whether the color of a spot has changed from black to white, or vice versa. What is the minimum number of sensors needed to find out which way the disk is rotating? What is the best, average, worst time to figure out the direction? If you use more sensors, can you improve the best, average, worst time? How can you accomplish that? If you are given only one sensor, how can you find out the direction, assuming you can change one constraint of the problem?   1 Answer

I was called for face-to-face round after telephonic screening round. The interview was based on logical questions and C language constructs. Questions ranged from set theory, venn diagram, recursive functions in C, for loop syntax and logic inversion. Good focus on data structures and algorithms. It was very interesting interview. Overall I enjoyed the experience.

I faced a simple but interesting question. In a for loop condition statement, how can u invert the logic by changing a single character.   1 Answer

I was approached by a recruiter within days after I posted my resume at an online site. Apparently one of the new groups was looking for a person with my skills and domain knowledge. I was scheduled to have a phone interview which was more of an information exchange. I was invited to a full day of interviews (6 of them), all of them went pretty smoothly. The questions were in-line with what can be found in on-line blogs. After a few days, I was offered the job which I accepted. Overall my interview experience was great.

two words: rigorous and stressful! In one of the several 1:1 I felt as I am being interviewed by a genius, a person of inhuman intelligence. Not only I didn't know the answer, I could barely understand the questions. And BTW, as interviewer confided later, the answer to his question wasn't known even to him, it was an unsolved computer science problem, and he hasn't really expected that I'll come up with an instant solution :)

It was on campus interview. 5 rounds total, including 2 written. Main focus was algorithms, data structures and programming. You also need to have a strong hold of how to determine complexity of algorithms. Most interview questions were like you were given a problem - you had to propose a solution - write algorithm, determine complexity and then code it.

I don't remember clearly. All the questions were based on algorithms and programming.   Answer Question
