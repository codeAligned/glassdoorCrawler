2015-01-14 07:24:44.443,i went through the college recruiting process. microsoft was among the companies that set up stations at our computer science major recruiting fair where i signed up. the first round was on campus  lasted about 40 minutes  and was easy for a computer science major. about a week later  a recruiter emailed me to tell me that i was being invited for on site interviews in redmond  seattle   wa. the recruiters are extremely fast and helpful in communicating  interestingly  microsoft s recruiting process outdoes other companies  google  fb etc  completely in efficiency and generosity. you re flown out to redmond and stay in a really comfy hotel with a generous spending budget. now  it s good to know how on site interviews work  you begin your day early by meeting with your recruiter  who you should befriend since they are  on your side   so to speak  and their input can matter in the decision process. then  you have consecutive technical interviews lasting about an hour each. you don t have to do perfectly in all of them  but i had a very strong feeling that the first 2 are the most important. the first one is particularly important. if you are doing well  you will get a 4th and sometimes 5th technical interview. if you re lucky  you will afterwards get a final interview with a manager of sometimes  like in my case  a really impressive big boss type person. this big boss can basically hire you on the spot  and its pretty cool that you get to meet someone like this. don t forget that for microsoft  as well as other companies  several things matter for college recruiting  your interviews  first and foremost  but also your coursework  projects  grades  internship experiences  etc. also  knowing more math than average cs majors helps. the next day i found out that i was getting an offer  and the next business day after that my recruiter called me with the details over the phone. microsoft really  really wants smart new grads. the company and culture has really been improving the past few years  and they want smart new grads to keep that up. offers are actually more generous than at other competing companies. in my case  you might really like the people you meet or have a personal connection with the big boss type person at the end  in which case your offer could potentially be for the team you actually interviewed with. in this case  you have a choice whether you want to be with that team or go back in the general  hired  pool which is distributed into teams at some later point.,thing of a simple o n 3  algorithm for finding the longest palindrome in a string. now a o n 2  one. now a o n log n  one.   1 answer

2014-12-19 12:09:32.19,was contacted by phone and email 2 months after applying online and through campus recruiting. phone interview consisted of fairly basic data structure questions involving stacks queues and things like bucket sort. i was surprised by how tailored to my resume all of the other questions were  though. so make sure that you know everything you put on your resume well enough to speak strongly about. i made this mistake but it was apparently minor enough since i got invited for onsite interviews. flew out to seattle within 2 weeks of my phone interview. we stayed in the commons and hung out with a large   40  group of other applicants for various positions  mostly sde intern. it was pretty neat as we got to ride a party bus to the campus. the waiting room for all the interns was very nice. large touchscreen tv for fruit ninja  another large surface table for other minigames  catered snacks and drinks. i was an afternoon interviewee so we went to lunch first. the microsoft lunch area is very nice. we got a  10 voucher for any restaurant type establishment. everything had a bit of an upscale mall food court feel in a good way. drinks were also free for all employees  which is cool. i was interviewing for a position in msit  which is microsoft s internal tooling software teams. things like the enterprise e commerce division and others. three technical interviews which were equal parts conversational and coding and one completely conversational job fit. again my resume topics were discussed quite a bit more than i expected. my interviewers were very interested in projects that i had worked on in groups and broad design choices we had made  so if you have any  be ready to speak to them. the interviews went well enough  though i think i choked in the last technical interview. they gradually make your solutions more and more difficult by adding restrictions like runtime and allowed data structures. it got to a point where i simply didn t have an answer  but that might be what they re looking for. 2 business days later  i got a call with an offer from my recruiter for an sde position. a slightly lower base salary from the average  but i suspect they re including at least part of the  very  generous benefits package that microsoft provides.,lots of string manipulation and conceptual oop questions. wasn t expecting that based on the frequency of graph tree questions that i felt was more the norm from other internship interview reviews.   answer question
2014-12-05 21:21:29.057,i am a mechanical engineer by training with past programming experience for primarily personal projects  video games and such  in multiple languages. i m currently in a phd program finishing up the masters portion. i casually chatted with a recruiter at a university career fair who told me that he will pass on my resume and that there  may  be something for me at microsoft but he doesn t know what. he told me to contact the university recruiter in a few days and she might be able to help me better. they called me for a screening interview for an internship the day after. i m not   what i like to call    classically trained  when it comes to computer science. i prepared for the screening interview by going through the mit ocw algorithms and data structures course and also reading miller and ranum s  problem solving with algorithms and data structures.  the screening interview went better than expected. among other things  i was asked to design a parking lot and write code for detecting palindromes. a few weeks later i got a call for a final round interview. it took a while for them to schedule an interview and they gave me a date which was 3 days after a major deadline with my sponsor and so i requested a later date. the scheduler worked with my availability and got me a date that worked. they flew me to redmond for an interview with the bing team  i wasn t given that information until the morning of the interview . i was supposed to get 3 to 5 interviews. my first interviewer was late because he missed an email sent by the receptionist. everything after that went smoothly. i got through all 5 interviews. the third interview was over lunch  we wrote code after  not during . the fifth interview was with a program manager. the questions seemed relatively easy. the topics were  queue design  common ancestor search in a tree with no underlying structure  mixed uni and multi byte character strings  detection of unique addresses  and linked list scanning and element removal. some interviewers wanted me to just solve a problem as well as i could. others were looking for a discussion of the problem  one of which was actually very interesting and have the interviewer some new ideas . at the very end i asked the hiring manager some subtle questions about my performance and what kind of competition i was facing. it s nice to be told that there is a  high probability  of them making an offer   ,suppose you have a string which has characters that are either one or two bytes long. a one byte character has 0 as the left most bit. the first byte of a two byte character has 1 as the left most bit but the second byte s left most bit  lmb  could be either 1 or 0. implement an algorithm for removing 1 character from the end of the string. how would you do it while scanning backwards from the end of the string. followup  what if you needed to do this repeatedly  is there some way you could reduce the time complexity to constant    1 answer

2013-11-18 22:21:26.473,the communication started through career fair. when i gave my resume to one of their representative  current engineer at microsoft   he quickly asked few questions to get to know about my background. later he told me that he would forward this to one of the recruiter and he will contact me if there is a suitable match. i had to raise my eyebrow here  cause the guy has my resume and he asked me several questions. this alone should be enough to proceed ahead with interview or no interview. reading other posts  it seems ms conducts onsite campus interviews  then why forward to recruiter. perhaps  due to lower reputation of my university  they do not want to spend too much time interviewing people onsite. a couple of weeks later  i got an email to schedule a phone interview. at last  something is better than nothing as i get about half an hour to prove my capacity. i have gone through interview posts here on glassdoor and i could not find any details on phone interviews. most were either college interviews or people talking about their onsite interviews after passing phone interview. in any case  i prepared myself with the questions posted and later on i realized those were overkill for the phone interview. now  i have gone through plenty of phone interviews with multiple tech giants. in most cases  i have made it to later rounds in phone interview  but no onsite though. well  i just want to say i have become quite comfortable with these initial interviews  both technically and behaviorally. the interviewer called on time and we started with discussing my background. this was already done when i submitted my resume  so i see no point in reiterating all this. although  i was asked similar questions in my past interviews  but on those occasions  i did not forward my resume personally and the initial phone calls were the first time when i spoke to someone inside the company. next i was asked several semi technical and behavioral questions. most of these questions are already discussed elsewhere  therefore i will not emphasize much on those. however  i will mention some of them below  cause i think it s on these questions i may have under performed. as for other questions  i am sure  design a table    test an elevator  and  determining apple  orange and apple orange from incorrectly labelled boxes  should ring a bell or you will certainly encounter them if you search on internet. few days later  i got the usual no offer email. the only positive thing i can take is they told me to reapply in 6 months. from what i know  they usually give a 1 year clause  therefore this was a good rejection  i hope. i did give some ridiculous answers which could be a good reason for rejection. i will discuss them in question sections below. perhaps you guys could judge if this is certainly worth getting a rejection.,how many lines of code have you written in your favorite project    3 answers what is your favorite microsoft product  what feature would you add to it    1 answer

2013-12-09 02:20:24.61,got a mail requesting for an interview at university. the interviewer asked questions about my experience and a coding question involving multiple threads and some general algos questions. after clearance  recruiter contacted me to schedule onsite interviews at redmond. at the campus  the day started with a chat with hr and then a total of 6 technical rounds including 1 lunch technical round  from different teams in the core os group . questions asked were generally core os multithreading  deadlocks  concurrency   algorithms simple ones with complete coding  and some on work experience. overall  the experience was nice and the interviewers were very friendly. two days later  i got a reject mail. the reason for my reject acc to me  is my substandard implementation of a stack using an array compounded by my miserable performance in the last round. i felt that the interviewers exchange the performance of the candidate about a possible weakness and the next interviewer will look to confirm that  and if that s the case  the red flags would be raised.,No Question

2013-04-25 08:11:03.26,initially turned in my resume during a campus career fair. approximately two weeks later i was emailed by a recruiter who asked me to participate in an on campus interview  i.e.  first round . the campus interview was with someone who wasn t a recruiter and had clear technical expertise. this interview lasted approximately 25 30 minutes. we mostly talked about items on my resume  whether or not i faced any unique challenges and if so  how i overcame them. this was a very conventional interview. upon the conclusion  i was asked a technical question. about three weeks later  i was emailed again by a different recruiter who asked me if i was available to fly out to redmond  wa for the second round interview. i had a very compact window to interview within  and the recruiters did a great job setting everything up within my constraints. on interview day  the first step is to meet with another recruiter who is on site  who will discuss the group   team you will be interviewing with  and answer any other questions you may have at the time. this recruiter is also the one who will tell you the results  and work further with you should you get an offer. after meeting the recruiter  you take a personal shuttle to the buildings where your interviewers are. mine were all in the same building. next you meet with 3 5 interviewers  and one of the interviews is a lunch interview. you are told beforehand that each interviewer passes on comments to the next one  presumably so they can confirm   deny a weakness. for me  the first interviewer didn t want to talk about my resume at all. he was more or less the manager of the group and was very blunt about the skills he was looking for. some non technical questions were   what would you change about windows     what do you read to stay on top of the latest technology     what are some examples of trending applications  . then he went to the coding problems. one a mathematical proof  and the second more coding oriented. the next interview was over lunch  and this interviewer asked me initially about my research  but quickly started trending towards questions that were more oriented towards the group. after lunch we went back to his office and i was asked another coding problem. the third interview was more theoretical. the interviewer briefly talked about my research and that it looked interesting  and then we went into an open ended math   optimization problem. after the third interview  i was told that i would not be seeing the fourth interviewer  this means you failed   and i was taken back to hr to discuss the day with the recruiter. i should point out that the recruiter was very helpful and looked into other groups that might have been a better fit. overall  the interview was very challenging. you absolutely need to be prepared to code and solve difficult problems. the second round is not about what you have done  but rather what you can do now  in a high pressure situation. also  you are told that you can code in any language  but in reality  you need to be able to code in c c . not being familiar with either  i tried to use python so as to not get bogged down in syntax  but it was generally not well received.,on campus   first round 1  write a function that returns the indexes of a character in a string second round 1  prove that for a set of numbers that are  prime    non prime    prime   ex. 11  12  13  the non prime number is always divisible by six. 2  write a class that adds or removes data from a queue 3  write a class that can store and interpret large integers  i.e.  numbers that cannot be stored as an int . the class must be able to perform mathematical operations on the represented data. 4  you are an owner of a building  which has a broken revolving door. what time do you replace the door    1 answer

2013-01-26 03:14:16.923,i posted the questions below. this post is focused on the final onsite interview not the hr or first round interview. i really didn t like the process. i was interviewing for sde but got mostly design questions nothing on data structures and algorithms. if you are good at designing software architectures the uml implementation  then you would have aced it. only 3 interviews for me. some advice the process is so random  you can get easy interview questions or hard ones. so i think getting hired is mostly based on luck and the focus of the questions they ask you and how experienced the interviewer is. 2 of my interviewers were at microsoft for a long time so they were really cooperative  one guy was pretty new there and wasn t very responsive when i told him my solution. like i said i applied for sde but all the questions were mostly on design nothing about algorithms. no testing  no time complexity analysis.,find the last substring occurrenance s first element  example string  abcdefab  and substring  ab  awnser should return 6   1 answer design an elevator uml implementation threads  syncroniczation and locking    2 answers design the game battleship uml  implementation    answer question reverse a sentance   1 answer
2013-02-26 10:33:54.2,microsoft came to our campus and i submitted the resume. was originally scheduled an on campus interview but it was cancelled by hurricane sandy. so they had a phone interview. the phone interview was not hard  i was asked to compare two binary trees to see if they are identical  and to design a vendor machine. after two weeks i got an email about further steps  seems like msft has a long candidate line so i was scheduled an on site interview on january. candidates were gathering in the lobby of building 111 and recruiters came one after another to talk with us. then we are given the info of interviewers and they had shuttles to take us to different buildings. the interviewers are nice  they tried to be inspiring and helped me through the technical questions. i was sort of unsatisfied about the later interviewing process because after the fourth interviewer  i was sent to the fifth guy and was told that i need to wait for an hour. after waiting in the lobby for 45 mins  the guy showed up and told me that my day was over. i didn t expect that i could get an offer from microsoft  but keeping ppl waiting and then letting them go is definitely not professional.,1. write a singleton class and make it thread safe 2. merge two sorted arrays 3. remove duplicates in an array 4. did you ever write any code just by fun    answer question

2013-04-15 16:54:53.767,although i did not get a job offer  overall it was a nice experience. now here  i have to nullify a myth. they say that if you get 5 interviews and if the last one is with a senior manager  then you d get a job. nope. never. i got five interviews and the last one was with a very nice senior person working there for 35 years and still i got rejected. went to redmond a few months ago in a snowy winter day  there were five interviews  1  a very strict  but polite  person  no smile on the face  explicitly telling me that he wont help me and wont give me any hints. it was all about quickly writing a bug free c   code to find a pattern in a string  implementing a post order tree traversal with and without recursion and a few research design problems. 2  an extremely nice korean guy who asked about hash tables lookup insert collision in ht and implementation in c  . there was another question about writing all permutations of a given string. 3 and lunch interview  a very nice person  willing to help  he told me to develop an algorithm for finding whether a matrix has some properties or not. it was 5 months ago and i forgot the question. i could solve the question but he was looking for a more efficient algorithm. he was willing to help and gave me hints but time was up and he gave me to the next interviewer. he told me that i was going to the right direction. 4  the fourth interviewer was very odd. i hope his behavior was planned intentional and he is not like this. from our conversation  it was obvious that this guy is very smart. he wrote a long input string with lots of delimiters in the white board and asked me to write a c code to change the given string it to another format based on some rules. it was a horribly vague  twisted question with lots of unknowns and exceptions. in the interview  he was taking nap time to time and he left the room at least three times. again i hope that this was a test to see my reaction. the reason that i hope for the best is that at the end of the interview  he was the only person who gave me very honest feedbacks and compliments. but if it is not the case  that was awfully extremely rude. so he passed me to the final interviewer... 5  a senior manager  working in ms for 35 years. very cool  very smart and very fun  it could be easily observed by the flags decoration in the room some wine on the table in his room    by the way  i didnt have any whatsoever behavioral questions during my day. so this time  he just started chatting with me which i guess was the behavioral part of the interview. talking about everything except work  about big corporations  hacking   and so on. it was truly an amazing experience with that person. based on the book  i surely have gotten the job  but ....one week later  i got rejected.,given a long input string with lots of delimiters in the white board  i was asked to write a c code to change the given string it to another format based on some rules. it was a horribly vague  twisted question with lots of unknowns and exceptions.   answer question

2013-01-10 02:31:14.357,i got in touch with them by a referral from someone at my university who got a job offer with them. first there was a very simple phone interview in which they asked some pretty varied questions  such as how i would explain the internet to a young kid and how i would test a vending machine. they always finish with a small logic puzzle which are pretty easy and you ve probable even worked with if you ve been programming for a while. afterwards  you re supposed to fly to redmond but they gave me a 50 50 thing  where i would take 2 3 interviews by phone to screen you  and if you pass you fly to redmond for the last batch. the interviewer by phone asked me some questions about pointers  recursion  and some basic data structures  but he took it as in depth as possible. definitely brush up on your data structures. after this  i got sent to redmond where i had 2 interviews. one was with someone from ms office. she was a charming lady who just portrayed peace to me  so it was really nice. she asked me to write a pre order traversal that worked iteratively instead of recursively. this wasn t bad at all but again  data structures. my next interview was with a guy from server  azure to be more specific . he asked me to make a stack  but he took it down to ever little. since i wanted it do it with a linked list he asked me to implement a linked list first and just kept squeezing every little detail out. afterwards  he asked me to make it thread safe which was very easy. then he through a trick question at me about how exceptions would make my stack fail...and i didn t get the answer. about 45 mins later a guy from hr took me to a room to tell me that i didn t get the position. he was very cool about it and ms staff is extremely friendly  which is somewhat bad since it s harder to read how you do. all in all  great experience and i hope to make it next year.,having a stack that s thread safe  if the pop   method goes inside the if clause and context switches right before throwing an emptystack exception  when it context switches  and in the context switch a value is pushed into that stack  it will throw the emptystack exception even though it s not empty. how do you fix this    answer question

2012-02-27 23:10:40.51,my interview was for a msit sde position  so my experience may have been somewhat different from interviews with product groups. i had my resume given to a recruiter by a classmate who was recently hired by microsoft. i was given a phone interview in december  and on the phone was told that i would be contacted for an in person interview at the redmond campus. i flew in on a thursday  and microsoft put on a meet and greet event for all of the candidates. free food and open bar  plus a chance to get to meet current microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. it was a lot of fun  and i think helps candidates relax and gain a bit of confidence before interview day. in january  i received information and scheduling for my on site interview. microsoft paid for my flight  hotel  food and other costs. in february i was informed the interview would consist of four 1 hour interviews  at the end of which i would find out whether or not i would be given an offer. i flew in on a thursday  and microsoft put on a meet and greet event for all of the candidates that evening. there was free food and open bar  plus a chance to get to meet current microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. it was a lot of fun  and really helped me relax and gain a bit of confidence before the interview day. we were given packets that had our schedule for the next day  stating whether you would interview in the morning or afternoon group.   the interview   we were shuttled to the microsoft campus  where we had breakfast and a brief meeting with the recruiters before our first interview. first interview  met with a sdet who had been with microsoft for over a decade  and had been a pm previously. very friendly  asked mainly general questions about my experience  what i m interested in  etc. then  he asked me to design a subscription service system. after asking a few questions i found that he wanted the tech stack that i would build it on  with justifications for some of the choices. overall  this interview went very well. second interview  i met with a pm who asked me some more general questions  asked me about a previous project i had worked with. no technical questions  and this interview also went quite well. third interview  meeting with a sdet who asked me about past experience  how i got into software engineering  since i m an mis major . he then asked me how i would test the whiteboard  followed by how to test a piece of paper. finally he asked me to write a method to remove all instances of a certain character from a string. he then modified it asking for how to remove a string of sequential characters from a string. the testing questions threw me a bit initially  but i still felt pretty good by the end of the interview. fourth interview  met with an sde who briefly asked me about my resume  then jumped into questions on oop. can you explain oop to me. what is a class  what is an object  what is multiple inheritance and what are its drawbacks  does c  or java allow multiple inheritance  how is this problem solved  finally she asked me to reverse a linked list  which i completely botched. i had seen it several times before  but just couldn t get the algorithm right. i didn t solve it before our time ran out  and had to leave it unfinished. at this point  i was feeling pretty nervous about my outcome. we were taken to lunch and when we returned  we were told our results would be given to us shortly. my name was called first  which i assumed meant the worst. the recruited told me   i hate to do this to you  but we want you to meet with one more member of the team.  i had a final interview with another sde  he was very direct and jumped right into the technical question. i was asked to write a method to find the max int in an unordered binary tree. i nailed this question  which i think got me the offer. i was later told that they sometimes ask for an additional interview to determine fit within the team  how true this is i don t know. i then returned to the lobby to wait a bit more to hear my results  and was finally called back and told i was getting an offer. final thoughts   advice the process is pretty intense but also very enjoyable. if you can  make sure to attend the event the night before the interview. it helps you gain confidence  because you get to see them as normal people  not some sort of mythical geniuses. plus  by being sociable  displaying interest and being excited about the opportunity  you can put yourself in a good position with potential interviewers. my surprise fifth interview was with a guy who i had a pretty good conversation with the night before and joked a bit with during the event.,describe oop.   answer question remove all instances of a character from a string. modify to remove all instances of a sequence of characters from a string.   1 answer reverse a linked list.   answer question find the max int in an onordered binary tree.   2 answers

2012-05-10 18:18:20.0,the process began when i gave my resume to a recruiter at our yearly engineering career fair  in october . she asked me a couple generic questions about my resume   tell me about this position    what s something hard you encountered   and why i wanted to work at ms. she took the resume and i got a call a week later about scheduling an on campus interview. the on campus interview occurred about a week after  in early november. this interview  and every interview after  had the format of  5 10 min  tell me about yourself resume   30 min technical question  and the rest of the time  do you have any questions for me   i felt like the interview went well and i was invited to an ms hiring event weekend in december for a day of interviews. when mid december rolled around  i flew to seattle and was put up in the westin bellevue. the first night  all software and hardware recruits  about 80 of us  for internships   full time offers  were taken to an event at the lucky strike bowling alley where there was lots of good food  an open bar  and bowling. we also got a chance to talk to our recruiters and ask them any questions about the interview process. the next day  we had 4 interviews in a row. one group had interviews in the morning  8   12  and the others had theirs in the evening  1   5 . we found out which group we were in the night before. in addition the morning group had lunch after the interviews and the late group had lunch before. each group of interviewees met in the same room before the interviews  to eat lunch  and between them. most people wore business casual attire. the schedule was  interview  15 minute break  interview  30 minute video about working at ms  interview  15 minute break  interview. interviewers would call us one at a time from the room before the interview  take us to a room to conduct the interview  and then take us back after. at the end of the day  we all went to the same building to play xbox games and play with the ms surface. then  our recruiters called us one by one to privately tell us if we received the offer or not. i m glad i got the offer  but the recruiter first quizzed me on how i thought i did and if i had any other offers  and the strong points of my other offers  and how i would feel or what i would do if i did get an offer. i thought that was a little low  since it seemed like she was toying with me and i still didn t know if i had the offer or not at that point. nonetheless  i was very happy once i got an offer and to hear the terms of the offer  too  i didn t accept on the spot  but my recruiter was hoping i would  p after that  we were taken home in shuttles and free to do what we wanted. i chose to stay an extra night instead of fly home right away and i hung out with some friends in the area. i flew back the next morning. in terms of preparation  i didn t do anything special besides reading the book programming interviews exposed  2nd ed.  and reading up on interview questions on this site and by googling  or binging     . the more you prep  and the more introspective you are about your method of solving a problem  the better. in addition  it s really important to be charismatic and passionate about the position group you re applying for and to be genuinely interested in finding out if the company is a good fit for you. as cheesy as it sounds  when you have that  and if you prepare ahead of time   then the right job offer will simply present itself.,write a function to determine if a binary tree is balanced or not.   2 answers write a function to convert a number in roman numeral form to a decimal representation.   3 answers write a function to print out the contents of a singly linked list in reverse order.   3 answers write a function to find the location of k consecutive 0 s in a bitstream of length n   answer question write a function to solve a problem given one set of constraints  then  changing some  but not all of  the constraints  decide how you will change your function  and see if that function still handles the initial set of constraints.   1 answer
2011-12-12 16:16:41.833,applied through the microsoft website and interviewed on campus. i was pleased to hear that i was selected to be flown up to seattle and interview with the online services division  bellevue  wa not redmond . i will state early on that i completed the interview process and received no offer   however  with that said  i will be as objective as i can be about the experience. firstly  understand that although microsoft does every single thing possible to try to show how  fun  they are  by far the number one thing the interviewers look for is the ability to think and code just like any other large software company. everyone who says that it s important to be social and personable at microsoft must have interviewed with a different division. with online services  all that matters is coding  problem solving  and wanting to tackle new problems. during your day you will have four 45 minute interviews  with 15 minute breaks in between. after that you will hear immediately whether or not an offer will be extended. this is absolutely amazing by microsoft. to have that feedback so instantaneously is incredible and truly first class of the company. these interviews will be intimidating to say the least and i can virtually guarantee you that you will run into one or two people that you really like and think are cool  and one or two that make you second guess if you really want to work there. each interview has a coding question. my four were as follows  1  given the in order and preorder traversals of a binary tree  rebuild the tree. 2  given a sparse n by m matrix  find the number of distinct paths within that matrix  each cell can be off or on  find the number of distinct sets of connected cells . 3  given the android 3x3 matrix lock screen  generate all the possible unlock combinations that one can enter. 4  given an array of integers  find all the unique elements. i botched the first question. it was 8am in the morning when i attempted it and i had been up since 6 30. to be quite honest  i had forgotten to review the tree algorithms. i met with the interviewer and he literally bombarded me with questions. if you say  anything  be prepared to defend it and back it up. there is also a strong sense that you must be very  very interested in working for microsoft. as one microsoftie put it   the people who work at microsoft choose to work there because they love microsoft  it s not that they cannot work for google or apple . there is little to no review of your resume. the emphasis is pretty much solely on your ability to code relatively generic  albeit challenging  programming problems. this can work to your advantage or it can be a disadvantage. to ace the interview  simply read a number of programming problems and study up on the division you are interested in. at one point in time  i was asked   if you were given a farm of 1000 computers  say  what problem would you try to solve  . find something that microsoft is trying to solve  or some generic problem in the division for whom you are interviewing. as i was not extended the offer  i cannot precisely tell you what it takes to succeed in the interview. however  here are a couple of observations i made  some of which are listed earlier   1  read up on the division for whom you are interviewing and understand their business well. 2  read up on many  many coding questions. if you read enough problems  chances are you will have heard a problem similar to the one you are trying to solve. 3  i cannot stress this enough  but to succeed you  must  ace the first interview you have. i told you how i botched the first question. i did not think to use recursion. in a later interview i had a question that could have used recursion  implementing a bfs   but i chose the iterative process. the interviewer remarked to me   your first interviewer noted that you don t use recursion  why don t you  . these interviewers talk to each other in between  as such  you must absolutely make a good first impression. if you can interview with microsoft  it is a cool experience. you get two free nights in a nice hotel room and all your expenses paid. it makes for an awesome trip to seattle. however  i really wish microsoft would cut down on the number of people they bring to seattle. reading through glassdoor  you will see  a lot  of people are not extended offers. why bring these people if you don t extend a great deal of offers  i feel their current system unfairly generates a lot of false hopes. if you are interviewing with the big m  i wish you the best. you will have a fun experience and it will be really cool to even just walk through those doors once. as the guy who told me the sad end of day news put it   we receive 10 000 resumes a week  and the fact that you made it this far attests to your skills . be proud that you received the interview and enjoy your experience ,given inorder and preorder traversals of a

2015-08-28 16:13:36.013,it is college recruiting. the first interview was in college about 1 hour  one coding problem about sorting  just write the pseudo code in a paper  not so difficult  the pressure is timing. then asked some questions about projects in my resume  and questions like how do you think to improve some microsoft products like ie etc. three weeks later i was informed they will fly me to redmond for onsite interview. i flied from florida and stayed at seattle for two nights  microsoft paid all the trip. the first night is a big dinner party with all other candidates over the country and microsoft managers employees who will interview us the next day. the dinner is not interview  just casual party with chatting  get familiar with each other  very friendly. at next day all candidates are divided into two groups  interviewed by morning and afternoon separately. i was in afternoon group  the morning is a bus tour for the microsoft campus  meeting and talking with hr and engineers  introduced the microsoft life  sports center  science center etc  they want you to like here  treated like we are one of them already. actually the hr told us once you are on campus interview  that means basically you are qualified to microsoft  but they only hire top half of us due to high competitiveness. afternoon interview has 4 turns  about 1 hour each with different development manager. each turn has coding question of course  write the pseudo code in white board. they are not very difficult  once you are in good hand in algorithm class  it should be ok  the timing and efficiency is the key. remember i said they only hire top half of the group  solve as many coding questions as you can in one hour with better efficiency  then you will stand out to the top half. i worked ok to the first and second turn  the managers are friendly  and asked question like how do you think about microsoft  any question expectation to microsoft product etc. but i failed at third turn  my coding solution looks complicated and inefficient  although i worked out  the manager pointed that and introduced better one to me  of course that means mine is not that good. the fourth turn means nothing then  the interviewer not on the interview mood at all  just asked some unimportant coding question to pass the time. so the result is obvious. all of us know the result right after the interview finished. they call the failed candidate one by one out of the room and told you very regretfully then you can leave. and the other half who still left in the room are offered... this is college hiring  all the candidates are undergraduate graduate  the experienced one may be different and more difficult. someone said since the 4 managers are from different team  if one or two are interested in you  then you may be hired  but by my experience that is not true  you have to pass by all 4 to get offer. the key is practice of coding problems consistently  from easy to hard  in short timing and good efficiency which make you competitive.,how do you think to improve some microsoft products like ie etc   answer question

2011-01-19 17:36:55.497,my first interview was a 30 minute on campus screen  one puzzle question and a few short  general cs questions. if you know anything at all  this is a piece of cake. the remainder of this review describes my on site experience. regarding travel arrangements  i experienced a flight cancellation for my return journey  but the travel team was very supportive and helpful  extending my hotel stay and rebooking my flight. regarding the interviews  most of the advice and information available here and elsewhere online is quite accurate  just note that they generally do not ask  mount fuji  questions anymore   and as there is a lot of it  if you are unable or too lazy to find it you certainly do not deserve an offer from any company  i will only give a brief outline of my experience. i arrived at the recruiting building in my rental car and managed to find a single open parking spot. after checking in at the desk  i had about 15 minutes to hang out in the lobby area with around 12 other candidates. they provide free drinks  xbox  and some weird machines running a program called something like  tell us about yourself   which i tried to use unsuccessfully. the recruiter took me to an office where we spent about 15 minutes going over the day  some interview advice  and a little about my goals and background  nothing technical or difficult. the first 30 minutes of my first  real  interview consisted of discussing his and my background and me asking lots of questions about the product since i had never heard of it. the remaining 30 minutes were filled by a problem on sorting  design  complexity  and pseudocode. he had a somewhat similar background so we had no trouble connecting. next was my lunch interview at a nearby cafeteria. there was a wide selection of reasonably priced food  though i had a voucher for a free lunch . i decided on a salad for ease of eating. we talked about the company  the team and my goals. back in his office  i worked out two problems on trees coded up in c  . the next interview was entirely coding  two of the questions were easy but the third gave me trouble  it was the craziest recursion i ve ever seen. make sure you practice with trees a lot  and don t bother much with general graphs. the interviewer gave me lots of tips  and i finished the code at the last minute. the fourth interview was more like the earlier ones  relatively informal conversation in the first half followed by a technical question  in this case design. i had to design a data structure to represent the state of a game. pretty open ended  i think the idea is just to have a dialog about design tradeoffs  memory vs. speed and so on . finally i was happy to make it to the last interview with an upper level person which involved more discussion of the team and my past experiences no technical questions. be sure to have something to say about every item on your resume difficulties you encountered  what you learned  etc. i briefly met the recruiter again and went back to the hotel. in a few days  i heard the good news from the recruiter. so my advice is  1  ask questions  be curious  and be enthusiastic about the team product and the company. if you are having a  conversation  and not just a dry q a  then you are probably doing this well. 2  spend a few minutes verbalizing your ideas before writing any code. 3  don t code silently. 4  practice coding on paper or a whiteboard before the interview  preferably with someone watching over your shoulder. it really helps  5  try to learn something from each interview  anything  then use it in a later interview  especially if the interviewer specifically gives you advice. they want you to succeed. remember this if you get nervous. this is mostly drawn from advice i ve heard elsewhere  but i found it to be particularly useful. good luck  also  everyone i encountered at microsoft was very nice and personable. the interviews felt mostly relaxed and enjoyable.,data structures and algorithms  with a bit of design and some soft questions about your goals and background.   2 answers

2010-12-26 06:24:23.93,i was contacted by a microsoft college recruiter. i initially applied for a software development engineer intern position but because i was in my last year of my master s degree the interviewer told me that i can t apply for an internship position because after the internship i wouldn t be going back to school anymore. so she decided to interview me anyway but consider me for a fulltime position. i wasn t sure if i want to move from my country to the states so i guess this thing was a major black ball for me  i guess . after all the questions were related to the projects i listed on my resume. she asked what was the most technically challenging project i worked for in the past. i didn t review enough my projects because i didn t have enough time and because mostly of them were os  kernel related and i mostly forgot how i did them and what were the major problems that i had to overcome. so an advice would be to review all the interesting projects that you did in the past in order to answer rapidly and accurately about them. i think this was the major reason that i didn t get an onsite interview  bacause the interviewer couldn t make a clear idea about the projects that i did .,what was the most technically challenging project that you ever did     answer question what is good code     answer question

2010-09-07 22:41:47.307,i made a general submission on microsoft s career site. about two months later  a microsoft recruiter contacted me and asked me some general questions about my background. she then directed me to another recruiter who asked me if i would be interested for a position on the msn team. i said i was interested  and a few days later  she set up a phone interview with the hiring manager. the phone interview was completely technical. i had to write code in a live meeting session. first i was asked to write some very basic html and css. then i was asked to code up a problem that was recursive in nature. i struggled a little bit  but was able to come up with a solution in the end. a few days later  my recruiter told me that microsoft wanted to fly me to seattle for an on site interview. a week later  i flew out for a day of interviewing. my interview consisted of three one hour interviews  and one 1.5 hour interview that included lunch. my first interviewer had me code up a pretty standard problem on the whiteboard. as i coded it up  she asked me questions about what i was doing and how efficient my code was. my final code was not very efficient  but that turned out to be okay as she was just looking to see how i think. she also asked me to describe a time where i solved a hard coding problem on my own. my second interviewer had me design the classes that would be required for a css parser that would ultimately try to compress a css file by merging redundant selectors. most of my time was spent designing the basic data structures and explaining how i would go about merging selectors. again  he was just looking to see how i think. my third interview consisted of a one hour lunch followed by a half hour whiteboard coding session. the lunch portion was pretty casual where we mostly talked about what i ve worked on in the past. the coding portion was pretty standard. i struggled a bit  but that turned out to be okay. i was told ahead of time that the fourth interview was contingent on how well the first three interviews went. so i was happy when i was told that i would have a fourth interview. the fourth and final interviewer was an old man who was higher up on the ladder. the interview was very laid back. he asked me questions like why i wanted to work at microsoft  how long i intended to stay  and if i plan to pursue higher education. it was my impression that if you make it to the fourth interview  it s already been decided that you re technically capable of working at microsoft. now it was time to see if you had the right personality to work there. two weeks later  my recruiter called me up with an offer. overall  very positive experience. every interviewer was very nice. they all tried to make me feel as comfortable as possible  giving me helpful hints when i started to struggle with a coding problem. they were definitely more interested in how you think than the final code that ends up on the whiteboard. perfection is not required.,you have a pile of coins. one of them is counterfeit  and its weight is different from the other coins. all of the other coins weigh the same. you are given a balance. how would you find the counterfeit coin  now code it up.   4 answers describe a time where you solved a hard coding problem on your own.   answer question why do you want to work at microsoft    answer question

2010-02-26 15:30:30.093,contacted by a recruiter. had a preliminary  skills phone interview   how long using x technology ... i was honest basically saying 15 years c    but   6 on the web and c  front. was called in for a day interview. i was told i would meet with three people. after my third interview  lunch   i was taken to meet with two other people  then walked to the door. on the surface  the interview was more or less normal. these guys were experienced software developers who were some nice  some grumpy  some arrogrant  some sociable  some not. normal. they ask me what i m working on  some questions about my past  then i ask what they re working on  and then each interviewer asked a technical question  it seemed like because they knew they were supposed to because it s microsoft. the questions were hard  but it wasn t as nitpicky as i feared  and after working through the problems i felt like i came to reasonable solutions. but i didn t get an offer  so maybe they didn t feel the same  honestly several of these problems i would have answered by classifying the algorithm  looking it up on wikipedia and coding. my last interview with the senior staff member was the worst. he didn t seem very interested in my answers. he asked if i wanted to change any of my answers to previous interviewers  as if somehow their were  right  and  wrong  answers  i guess. sticking to who you are and what you do best is the wrong way  he asks if i have any questions  but then provides non answers to the ones i ask  so i say no  i can t think of any. i asked about work life balance and got the distinct impression that i was way out of bounds. now that i think about it  i don t feel really good about the experience. between all the emailing between interviews  the trading info  the puzzles  and the trick questions  it seemed more like trying out for a game show than a job. i believe this guys were reducing me to a zero or one  hire no hire   and their questions were being taylored to make their decision. it was not about trying to understand who i am and what i could bring to the table. so i answer that i prefer references over pointers and i am a no hire  immature at best. in that regard  a bad experience. be prepared to be underestimated  under respected and not seen. after putting it out there for this kind of experience you will inevitably end up feeling like a fool. why do they use a process like this  one has to wonder about the experience working there if this is the recruitment setup. one guy intimated that they work pretty crazy hours there  so i suspect a big part of the interview was trying to find someone m  could own. not me i guess  though the technology was tempting. i would have tried it  i admit. the recruiter was on time with the no offer news  5 days   the best part about the interview  though i did enjoy talking to a couple of the guys . it worked out  i guess.,write code to quantize an image to 256 colors. write a routine to assign an optimal 256 color palette to an image.   1 answer write a function that has a variable number of for loops. really  how to enumerate an arbitrary dimensional set of array indicies...   answer question

2009-05-05 12:07:04.143,it started with a referral from a friend. i was contacted by a recruiter and offered a phone interview  which i accepted. the phone interview took place within a week. the phone interviewer seemed to be technically capable of analyzing my answers. the phone interview questions varied between high level design questions and low level technical questions. overall  she was cordial and happy to answer any questions i had. i was contacted within a couple days with an offer for the in person interview. apparently  they were trying out a new interview format where they bring in 30 or so candidates at a time  all to be interviewed on the same day. the interviews were still 1 1  but all interviews were conducted simultaneously  and the interviews were conducted at 45 minute intervals  with 15 minute breaks in between. it was a little different  but it allows us to socialize with each other and relax a bit before our next interview. after all interviews were finished  we sat through a couple product presentations  selling us on the products we might be working on. this occurred while the interviewers were making their decisions. we were told that all decisions would be made before we left  which was awesome. after the presentations  i was called out to a separate room along with a small group of other people. we were all given offers  i m not sure about what happened to the others. i got to meet the manager of the group i was hired for  who also happened to be one of my interviewers   and we talked about various teams that i could choose to work with. all of the recruiters were very nice and happy to help out. all of the interviewers did their best to sell their teams to me. overall  it was a great experience.,phone interview question  describe how you would implement the c standard library function atoi.   1 answer phone interview question  in c  why is it considered bad form for a function to return a pointer to a stack allocated variable  what happens if you do it anyway    3 answers phone interview question  what happens when the  new  operator in c   fails    2 answers count the number of words in a string  where a word is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non space characters.   1 answer determine whether a given binary tree is fully populated  where  fully populated  means that every internal node has exactly two children  and all terminal nodes are at the same depth.   2 answers
2009-12-22 18:14:57.497,i was interviewing for an sde position. i felt prepared for my interview. i left completely demoralized. the interviewers were certainly nice  and microsoft does a great job of making sure that you are comfortable. they paid for the flight  lodging  food  rental car  etc. when i arrived  i spoke w  an hr representative who seemed distant and unengaged with our conversation. my second interview was odd in the sense that the discussion focused entirely on arcane aspects of sql and some generic problem solving. that was fine  but then he posed a string interpolation problem on the whiteboard and asked me to write an algorithm... i am a ok with problem solving  but i am one of the cerebral  think it out  type of developers. tossing ideas on a whiteboard isn t how i do things.... and i think the interviewer picked up on this. ultimately  i came close to solving it  but i was feeling a bit pressured and out of my comfort zone. the third interview was with a very  very senior sde who proceeded to grill me on c c    memory allocation  stack frames  register allocation  etc. while my resume reflected some commercial c c   experience  that was over 10 years ago.... since then i have focused almost entirely on java .net and other languages. more importantly  the position i was interviewing for didn t require any c c   experience. the interviewer then chose to present a problem which involved the development of a  move  algorithm for cribbage. this was another  whiteboard  problem where given enough time  i could have solved it  but they really  really put the screws to you... and expect you to think on your feet... quickly. the last interview was a  fluff  interview during lunch  and i could tell that the interviewer was just passing time. another whiteboard problem followed where i had to develop a base 26 version of itoa    which was simple enough.... but i messed up on a bit of syntax... the bottom line is that while i was certainly capable of solving any of the problems  the medium platform they expect you to solve them is totally incompatible with my personal comfort zone. am i smart enough to work at ms  absolutely... i have over 20 years of industry experience using a variety of microsoft tools and platforms. i also have a proven track record of architecting  developing and delivering secure  high volume websites and enterprise systems. this is no bs... i can do the job. however  there is a definite culture clash between ms and i. i have been told that other dev groups at ms are similar with their approach and style... which is why i will not be interviewing there anytime soon   ,write an algorithm that will determine the correct moves for given cribbage board.   1 answer

2009-07-10 13:15:57.36,msft has two rounds. 1st round is usually on campus. recruiters usually come to campus multiple times throughout the year. it s always not a big deal if you miss once   because they ll always come back again in a month or so. 1st round is half an hour. usually 5 min behavioral and the rest is tech. depends on how fast you are and the actual recruiter  the number of questions being asked could range from 1 to 5. it takes about 1 3 weeks to hear from the recruiter about the result of the 1st round. then they ll schedule an on site interview with you. usually you can choose four dates in the next coming month and they ll finalize one. they ll fly you to seattle  or other location you chose  and take care of all expense  hotel  transporation  meals etc . the on site interview takes one full day from around 8 15am to roughly 4pm. the actual length varies depends on your performance. usually you ll be interviewing with two groups  one in the morning and one in the afternoon and there s a lunch interview in between. you ll meet 2 3 interviewers from each group. if you really screw up your morning interview there could be a chance that your afternoon interviews will be cancelled  they ll tell you your next interviewer is sick or something . you ll get an offer from the group only if all interviewers say yes and if one or more says no you won t get one. so that means you still have two chances  two groups . each interview is 1on1  95  of the time taking place in the interviewer s office  and takes about 1 hour. the interview consists of short behaviral questions and majority is about tech questions. you will be writing code on whiteboard. at the end of each interview  the interviewer will bring you to your next interviewer. they will exchange about questions already asked to you and your performance. if you make your way to see the dev manager in the end   the last interviewer  that means you are doing a decent job. if you don t even get to see the manager that means 99  likely you are already out. in the past it usually takes about 1 week after your on site interview to hear about the result  could be longer if you don t get an offer . but now they expedite that to immediate result   you ll be asked to return to building 19  it was optional in the past . and if your recruiter wants to see you that means you ll be hearing about an offer. and if you are told you can leave and wait for result  that possibly indicates a negative answer. now they are experimenting new interview process which is more similar to cisco s  which consists of 4 interviews which only take half a day  plus some site seeing and presentations. the compensation is 80k  software development engineer   89  base plus up to 20  bonus  realistically  less than 10   plus stock options. standard benefits   401k  free insurance  health  dental  vision   espp and other misc stuff. it s lower b c cost of living is a lot cheaper than bay area and the tax is a lot lower too. relocation is 5k. you have 2 weeks to accept or decline the offer.,given an array with length n 1 which contains integers of the range 1 to n. each element is distinct and appears only once. one integer is missing. find the missing integer in linear time using o 1  memory. now two integers are missing  find them out in linear time using o 1  memory. how about three    8 answers

2011-04-17 21:41:59.397,microsoft came to my uni a while ago to find new some recruits. they promised pizza and a chance to win an xbox if we went to their seminar so i decided to go check it out. they were true to their word about the pizza    and i gotta say that there was an awful lot of it    but it turned out that you needed to hand in your resume if you wanted the xbox  i had to run to a computer to print one out  anyway  i didn t expect to get a response  my resume s pretty bad  so imagine my surprise when i got an e mail from them a few weeks later asking me to come in for an interview  my interview was broken up into two parts    a discussion about my interests and experience and the  fun  part that involved applying my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. the first part involved answering a bunch of questions about me and my interests. it was all the usual things you get in a typical interview  e.g. when did i first become interested in software development  what things have i ve worked on... the lady was pretty nice and smiled the whole time so i don t know if my responses were the right ones or not. the skills test was actually easier than i thought it would be. i was ushered into a room with a reasonably friendly guy and he handed me a pen  some paper and a sheet of questions. over the course of the test  i was told to answer three of them. they were actually things people could ve solved given enough time. unfortunately  it turns out that i don t do well under time pressure and i croaked as a result. when it was over  he thanked me and led me to the door. he said a couple of positive things about me and we went our separate ways. i m a bit disappointed at myself for messing up. however  it was a good learning experience and i at least got a free xbox for my troubles.,write a function that checks if a number s divisors sum up to that number  i.e. whether it s a perfect number or not.   2 answers calculate the angle between the minute hand and the hour hand of a clock.   answer question reverse a linked list.   1 answer

2011-03-21 20:30:18.167,submitted resume through my university and got invited to interview on campus two weeks later. the person in the career fair was very nice and helpful. one day before the interview  the two persons from microsoft held an event for all the candidates. very few questions were asked by the candidates as the two interviewers spent a lot of time talking about the company. the day of the interview  the interviewer was nice for about 2 minutes. after that  he started behaving very disinterested and spent more time looking at his laptop screen than listening to what i had to say. his behavior made me very nervous  and plenty of times he interrupted to give me hints that i didn t need. any pause for a few seconds would result in a comment along the lines of  you aren t doing what i asked.  two weeks after the interview i received an e mail to tell me i didn t make it to the 2nd round. my overall impression is that unless you can code recursive algorithms in less than five minutes  you shouldn t apply at microsoft. also to potential candidates don t forget to prepare for behavioral questions.,why do you want to be a software engineer    answer question given an array of sorted integers where duplicates are allowed  find the index of the first number i give you    7 answers what is the runtime    1 answer can you find a better solution    1 answer
