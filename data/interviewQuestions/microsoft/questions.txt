Four technical questions: 1) Given an MxM array make it rotate in a certain way. The rotation was a little complicated and I couldn't answer this question very well. The interviewer did not do a very good job explaining it.   Answer Question 2) Write a new version of strcpy where it will return the null terminator no matter what. Did a better job on this one the guy said he was evaluating for correctness not only for idea.   Answer Question 3) Given a string with many words make a function that would reverse all of the letters in every word. For this one I first wrote a crappy algorithm that takes O(n^2) but then I did a better one that worked in linear time.   Answer Question 4) This guy was more complicated he first asked me different questions about object oriented programming. I did not know what a virtual class was. He then asked me to do some string manipulation and kept making the problem harder until we ran out of time. The problem he started off with was write an algorithm that counts how many repeated letters are in a string and kept going from there. -- There was very few behavioral questions about my favorite projects.   Answer Question

Suppose you have a string which has characters that are either one or two bytes long. A one byte character has 0 as the left most bit. The first byte of a two byte character has 1 as the left most bit but the second byte's left most bit (LMB) could be either 1 or 0. Implement an algorithm for removing 1 character from the end of the string. How would you do it while scanning backwards from the end of the string.

A string is received, which contains from 0 to N numbers. Print all the possible combination of valid words, mapping each number in the string to a character in the telephone keypad. Assume no 0 or 1's are provided, as they do not have characters in it. A function bool isValid(string) is provided, so you may know whether a word is considered valid.   1 Answer Write a function which will receive an hour and minute from an analog clock, and calculate the inner angle between them.   1 Answer Write a for loop, which prints the odd numbers from 0 to N.   1 Answer Write a function that receives two pointers, and swaps the values between them.   1 Answer Implement a function that returns (or prints) a Fibonacci sequence. The function will receive two integers, an index (idx) and the number of results (N). The function should return the Fibonacci sequence starting from the idx and up to N results. Example: The Fibonacci sequence is as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... The sequence is supposed to be viewed as an array, so if index 6 was provided, calculations should start from number 8. Suppose index 3 is provided and 3 results must be returned. The result should be: 2, 3, 5.   Answer Question

For every language you have a resource file which contains hotkeys of every Module. For example: one module is File which has Find with hotkey F and Free with hotkey F and another module Edit which has Replace with hotkey R. For every module you want to find the colliding Hotkeys. In our example in module File: Find and Free have colliding hotkey "F". In the resource file a hotkey is coded as: \alpha"F"Find.Files; where \alpha is one character: alpha. You have 100 languages and around 6000 hotkeys in a resource file. Determine all the colliding hotkeys.   1 Answer

There is a disk on a turn table. Half of it is black, and the other half is white. It is rotating in constant speed, but it's rotating fast so that you can't see whether it's going clockwise or counterclockwise. You also have a set of stationary sensors you can install anywhere which can tell whether the color of a spot has changed from black to white, or vice versa. What is the minimum number of sensors needed to find out which way the disk is rotating? What is the best, average, worst time to figure out the direction? If you use more sensors, can you improve the best, average, worst time? How can you accomplish that? If you are given only one sensor, how can you find out the direction, assuming you can change one constraint of the problem?   1 Answer
