Terrible experience!!!! After the interview, the hiring manger calls and extends an offer verbally, and then for a week no response from them at all. Tried reaching them via email, phone, absolutely no response. Finally the recruiter is available on his mobile and he says they cannot give a certain Grade , and a certain salary, I still say its ok please give me an offer letter. He says he will get back to me by the EOD and no response. Next week I call the recruiter again and now he says the req is closed and in turn blames me for not responding on time. Clearly, looks like the hiring manger extended an offer but later they changed their mind and they have no idea how to communicate this to me, so did all sorts of things to make me drop the ball and when I did not they say the req is closed. Did not expect this from a reputable organization like Cisco. Terrible , terrible hiring process!! I feel interviewees should be give some respect when they take time to come onsite and spend a day. No point taking names, but I just wish this would be addressable and not be repeated for future candidates.

The interviewer was a very friendly person. He began by asking me about the projects that I had done in undergraduate school. Then he shifted on to a couple of design questions related to client server model and networking protocols. These were just basic questions and did not require in depth knowledge of networks. Then he asked one programming question. He asked me to suggest approaches to solving it. And later on, implement one of the approaches on a white board. Then he asked me if I had any questions for him. I asked a couple of questions and then it was done.

WORST interview experience ever. It started with a referral for application level position. Got an email requesting time for phone interview. After, deciding that got call from the same engineer that they have to fill the requistion so you will have to come onsite this week. So I rescheduled other interviews and went for the interview. When I reached the building my point of contact was not reachable. I waited in the lobby for 15 minutes and a gentleman from completely different team came and said I will interview you for my team. So from application team to a low level embedded team, what a jump. One of the interview asked me what is the balanced tree. I started explaining about the height and how difference in the height gets to the balanced tree. I was shocked to learn that interviewer's definition of balanced tree was a binary search tree. After explaining the interviewer and interviewer searching on the web for 5 minutes said there are these two definitions of the balanced tree and let's move on. One interviewer was very rigid about the hash chaining implementation. They wanted specific answers to specific questions rather than the thought process. The whole process was wierd.

A friend who worked at Cisco suggested I apply for the position. I applied through the website. A phone pre-screen with the internal recruiter was first, followed by a programming exercise that was done at home, followed by an in-person interview. I was told by the recruiter that there was a hard time limit for the exercise, but later the hiring manager told me that there was not, and I should finish the exercise which I had left incomplete due to time constraints. The recruiter was very slow getting back to me. I was able to reach out to the hiring manager to prompt more action from the recruiter. The interview went well, and the group and I got along well. Eventually an offer was made. I asked if I could get more, and eventually got a cash signing bonus.

Asked If I have any usage of SQL and GIT. And asked about my expertise. Got the result in 4 days, and the next round was with a panel of 7 members. 1 team member escorted to the meeting room and excused himself saying there is a priority. So it was a 6 member panel interview which went real smooth. There was no White Board coding. Asked so many questions from my resume like what was my contribution, Did I code any functionality from scratch... It was basically projecting yourself exactly the way your resume talks. This round was like a behavioral kinda as well - What challenges I faced. Finally 1 technical question was asked in Java - Difference b/w Interface and Abstract Class.

I applied in October through a university careers website, and was contacted 2 weeks later about an on-campus interview. The interview consisted of talking about my resume and some coding questions. My interviewer asked about all of the technical skills listed on my resume, and since I know Java, he asked me some Java language-specific questions (describe polymorphism in Java...). He also asked a brain teaser at the end. During the interview he told me I should expect to move on in the process because my GPA was high enough. About a week to 2 weeks after the interview, I received a letter of intent to hire from Cisco. I was asked to pick between San Jose, Atlanta, or Research Triangle Park. Also, I was asked to rank my preference for the following positions: Application Development, Embedded Systems, and Test Engineer. I sent in my preferences (I asked for Application Development, Research Triangle Park) but I was told that there were no positions other than Test Engineer available at RTP, so I was placed on a waitlist, with no guarantee of getting an offer unless something opened up. However, I heard back again with an actual offer within another 2 weeks. This was for Embedded Systems in RTP. The salary was not competitive with my other offers, so I declined. Also, there was no human contact throughout the entire process, other than the on-campus interview, and they didn't offer to even bring me in for an on-site visit, so I would not have felt comfortable accepting the position even with a competitive salary.

Brain Teaser: Involved thinking outside the box to come up with a solution. The interviewer gave me a hint and then I got the answer. I don't really see the point of this kind of question, because I had heard something similar to the brain teaser he gave me, and I was able to get the answer quicker because of it.   1 Answer

One of my former lab-mates ( from the University) referred me for a position at Cisco; I didn't even know what the position was (he thought it was a perfect fit for me). I got a call out of the blue (on a Saturday) from a person from Cisco, and asked whether I have time for an interview at that time. Unfortunately, I was travelling, and asked him whether we could prearrange a time, so that I could make myself available. He was willing to do that, but, he wanted to have the interview within the next couple of days. So, we scheduled it for the next day. During the interview he first asked me about my PhD research work. That went on for about 15min. He seemed mildly impressed (I think). Then he moved on to few behavioral, and technical questions. The technical questions were from Algorithms and DS, C/C++, OOP and Networking. Apart from couple of questions, I did well in the rest. The most difficulty I had was understanding the thick accent (South East asian, I think) my interviewer had. But, he was really friendly. Finally he went through my resume and asked me several questions about my experience and background. I thought he got more interested in my after that round, since according to him "I have an impressive resume". The whole interview went on for about 1hr, and he concluded by asking to contact him in about couple of weeks, if I didn't hear from him or Cisco. I followed up the interview by sending a thank you email to my interviewer; he once again asked me to contact him if I didn't hear from him soon. But, even after repeated emails (after waiting for 3 weeks), I am yet to hear back from him or Cisco. Overall, I had a positive impression about the interview (even though they called out of the blue, and asked me to interview in a hurry ~ I haven't had that experience with any other company). However, not getting back to me with their decision (don't care what it is), is really unprofessional for a company like Cisco. I don't think I would consider Cisco in the future, even though I am in the Networking field.

1. Define Storage Classes and explain application domain. register - tell to the compiler for use a CPU register for fast aceess for that variable. auto - it's a variable created and initialized when it is defined. It is not visible outside of the block. static - defined inside of the function retain its value between calls. Always is initialized with 0. Defined as global in a file is visible on for the functions from that file. extern - the definition of the variable is in another file. 2. Define the Storage Qualifiers const - define a variable that can not change its value along the program execution. volatile - define a variable that can be changed indirectly. An example can be a counter register that is updated by hardware. mutuable - a member of a structure or object can be changed even if the structure, for example is declared const: Ex: struct complex {mutuable int x; int y;}; const complex Mycomplex = {1, 2}; Mycomplex.x = 3; /* correct */ 3. Give an example for a variable "const" and "volatile". Is it possible? Yes, a status register for a microcontroller. 4. Detect if a linked list is circular. Need to use 2 pointers, one incrementing by 1 and another by 2. If the list is circular, then pointer that is incremented by 2 elements will pass over the first pointer. 5. Have you any remarks? #define res(a) a*a Using in this form the result will not be like we expect. Thinking that "a" is replaced with (2+3), then we will obtain 2+3*2+3 = 11 instead (2+3)*(2+3) = 25. Use always #define res(a) (a)*(a) 6. Define a "dangling" pointer Dangling pointer is obtained by using the address of an object which was freed. 7. Any difference between "const int*ptr" and int *const ptr" ? Yes, it's a major difference. First define a constant data and second define a constant pointer. 8. What is the declaration and definition of a variable? The definition contains the implementation for a method or variable declaration. This is just an example. 9. Give a solution for a stack overflow situation. func_call() { funct_call(); } Every time the above function is called the return address is stored onto the stack. Calling in this infinite loop will cause a stack overflow. 10. Give 4 examples for an infinite loop. a. while (1) {} b. for (;;) {} c. do {}while{1}; d. label: goto label;

Applied online and got a call from the HR to setup a pre-pre-screen! This was a 15-min. interview in which the HR went thru the motions talking abt my resume and experience. Few days later had a C-test. Not the easiest. If you are not a regular in C then you will take some time even though your C knowledge is complete. This was followed by two 45-min interviews with team member and engg. manager. I was very well prepared and the first interview went very well. He was thoroughly impressed. Then came the engg. manager. He seemed 'unprepared' about what to ask and started random questions on my experience. This also went well, later I thought some of my answers were incomplete but thought had done enough to get an onsite. Got a reject mail in a few days. Overall I thought the employees were very polite. It doesn't seem that Cisco needs brilliant people. People with good programming skills who know simple things like code optimization,data structures, few relevant projects go thru to the final stage. But,what I learned was that one position has about 10 people contesting and say 5 are upto the mark. After this I think the hiring decision becomes a subjective one . The engg. manager clearly seemed to have a bias towards CS guys. I was EE and his mood changed after hearing this.

Had two one hour phone interviews, one with the hiring manager, one with a technical lead. Both went well and a two day in-person interview was being scheduled. However, the day before the interview the hiring manager got in touch with me to let me know that the job req. was no longer available, but more would be opening in the next quarter. Waited until the next quarter and got my in-person interview. There was a programming test with three developers asking me questions. I ran long on the first one, the second question was based on code one of the interviewers put on the board (which had an unintentional bug), and the third one I dealt with well. Next came a one-on-one interview with another developer, but no technical questions were asked. The hiring manager was also too busy to actually interview me. At the end of the first day the hiring manager informed me he would be contacting me later that day to let me know the results. He did not get back to me until the next day to say they would not be extending me an offer.

The recruiter called me for a phone interview, the questions were pretty easy. It's more of a review of my resume and background. I was called into an onsite interview about a week later with the hiring manager. The questions were pretty easy, I guess it was because I was applying for an internship position. He asked me basic PHP questions, how does web application works, some networking fundamentals and some design questions. Then, I was interviewed individually by the entire team and extended team. It was a pretty long 5 hours interview. The interviewer were really nice and took a lot of notes during the interviews. You should really study and prepare for the interviews in both technical and soft skills questions. They offered me the internship about two weeks later.

Initial communications was via email. The HR representatives were quite friendly and prompt. The planning and organization of the interview was quick, simple, and professional. The people were the work quietly type, friendly enough, but not overly outgoing. Most worked at their own cubicles. Some advice for other interview candidates: be prepared to answer both behavioral and technical questions. I assumed that the first interview would consist only of behavioral questions...and I was wrong. Luckily, I managed to do ok on the technical questions. However, if you are rusty on coding principles...such as object-oriented design principles, I would freshen up on those. Expect to answer coding questions and write a few lines of simple code as well. In addition, you may be asked a few puzzles that force you to think critically. Overall, my interview experience was fairly short (less than an hour), and not too stressful.

The interview process started with the ubiquitous written round. This round had two sections viz technical and aptitude. The aptitude questions were witty and a bit confusing but were solvable. The technical questions were more concentrated on logic design and basic electronics with a bit of networking. There were 50 questions (30 aptitude +20 technical). The selection for the next round was based on some relative cutoff.. Around 250-300 people wrote the first test and 60 of us got selected for the next round. The second round was panel interview which the recruiters started immediately after declaring the results of the first round. My interview was conducted by a 2 member panel. My first round score was good as were my academics scores which aided gain some comfort in the interview. We had to submit the resumes before the interview started. My main subject of interest is networks, so they routed me to a panel which had an interviewer well versed in networks. I told my subjects of interests as networks and OS( operating systems). The panel members grilled me tested my technical knowledge relating to these fields. They asked me some questions on the projects that I had mentioned in my resume.The technical questions ranged from basics to specifics. The interview went on for around 30-35 minutes. I answered most of the questions (about 80-85%) with detailed explanation wherever needed but could not answer some of the questions for which my answer was a plain "I don't know, Sir". After the first round of interviews , they called me again and asked about my final year project and my plans on future studies and career. This lasted for 10-15 minutes after which all of us had to wait for around 3-4 hours meanwhile they completed the interview rounds for all the first round selects. Then there was a casual HR interview. The questions were also casual testing my soft skills. All these interview processes were carried out on a single day. After all processes and procedures they declared the names of the final selects at 12 in the mid night! They selected 13 people from our college out of them 8 were recruited for software engineering profile ( I was one of them :) ) and others for IT profiles.

2-3 technical Interviews, 1 HR round. Interviewers were very friendly and comforting and dont let you feel nervous. First they gave presentations about working at Cisco and how can it be a career boost. Then we had our first interview round where some general questions about algorithm design were asked. Second interview was more about networking and its fundamentals, and some puzzles, which i was notable to solve. Usually people were having only two interviews, but i was the only one who had three interviews, where they asked me questons about graphs. Fourth was HR round, where he asked me general questions about working there at cisco.

I did my summer internship at Cisco this year, for Internship there were two telephonic rounds. First one was technical round, all questions were from Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming Principles; second round was an HR Round where they asked me about my interests, family, etc. During the internship I applied for Full time job, where they took one written round, which had 50 questions (20 Math/MAT, 30 Technical) and was supposed to be done in one hour. Technical questions were from Digital Electronics, Computer Architecture, and Microprocessors/Microcontrollers. After written round there were technical, manager and HR rounds. In Technical round they asked me questions from my Projects, Data Structures and Sockets, Manager round had few technical questions and brain teasers, and HR round had questions like why I want to join Cisco, etc.

THe interviewer then narrated to me, what the team does. I was asked just one question and was allowed to code in the lang i preferred, though he told he would appreciate if it was C. I chose C itself as that was the language I was comfortable with. He put forward a problem which was more of a data-structure, design question and I tried solvin it slowly. He gave few tips me whenever and wherever i got stuck. It took 3 weeks, after which they responded with a reject.

The hiring manager called me up on phone and asked reasonable technical questions. Priority Invertion, Deadlock, Mutexes. Keep in mind that this was probably for a position which required very good OS concepts. I gave satisfactory answers and he arranged for a 1:1 the next week. The onsite interview had about 5 people. First one was hiring manager himnself. Gave a C test. Simple sorted array merging. I had rusty hands. Followed by another enginner who grilled me on OS concepts. How is executable format stored and loaded. Where are variables stored. How are interrupts handled etc. Majorly OS related stuff. Also recursion C questions. This was followed by another round of hard core questions on OS, threads and non amskable interrupts followed by a simple question on linked list. Need to know basics about datas tructures and algorithms. Which one is more efficient etc. After this a member from different team came by, asked some questions on my earlier work and another tree recursion program. This followed by the hiring manager of another team, asked basic question on my previous work and other problem solving scenarios when two processes are communicating with each other(IPCs). I was asked to come by for a second round after a week. The first 1:1 was difficult for me. Some questions on semaphores, mutexes. C programming question specifically targeting your knowledge of bitwise operators and memory management. Did not do so well. This followed by simple rounds by 2 other persons. Previous work. Multiple processor programming etc.. Overall, I probably needed more experience in the area that they wanted. Did not get the offer.
