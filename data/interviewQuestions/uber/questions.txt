He asked me a question that seemed very applicable to a javascript engineer, but just didn't make sense to ask if I wanted to code in java. It seemed like very quickly the engineer realized that he didn't think his question through, but it was too late at that point. Therefore for the next 30 minutes I proceeded to attempt to answer a question that was poorly constructed and just wasn't applicable. On top of this, the interviewer was in a very loud room with a lot of background noise so it was very difficult to hear from. Also he was constantly talking to another engineer that was also on the call with me, with who I imagine he was trying to get advice on how to improve the question. Additionally the call quality became very poor halfway through the interview and I pretty much could not understand anything he was saying. All in all, this was a very poor experience and I hope HR improves their interview process in the future.   Answer Question

Please find our standard web test below! Code Test! Bam! Uber clients are able to store favorite locations for easy pickup requests. Create a backend and a frontend for managing favorite locations. This is a simple exercise, but organize, design and test your code as if it were going into production. When you’re done, host it somewhere and provide us with a URL and a tarball or Git repo with the code. Backend Using the language (Python preferred), libraries and data store of your choosing, create a JSON in/out RESTful API for managing favorite locations. Stay away from Django or Rails, but microframeworks like Flask (preferred), Sinatra or Express are fine. Attributes of a favorite location object include: id, lat, lng, address (e.g. 800 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94114), name (e.g. Work) Frontend Using JavaScript, Backbone.js and any other libraries of your choosing, create an interface to access the API. User should be able to: Create a new location Read/view a location, and a collection of all locations Update an existing location Delete a location The UX is up to you, with a couple of constraints: Incorporate a map Geocode the address so the user is not required to enter lat/lng Extras If you like, get creative and do whatever else you like on the backend and/or frontend to show off.   1 Answer
