2015-09-03 18:03:04.85,got called by the recruiter. scheduled the technical phone interview soon after. the process was quick and smooth. the interview was focused mainly on mobile architecture. i ve done mobile development in the past but wasn t too familiar with architecture details  so faltered a bit while answering. this was followed by a question on a design pattern. i had never heard of this pattern before. i took my time to understand the question with some help from the interviewer. he was quickly frustrated within 3 4 minutes and told me he was looking for developers with better coding skills. i disagree that i have bad coding skills just because i couldn t answer the question without frustrating the guy. also  he should have understood that it s really hard for someone to implement a design pattern if they have never heard of it before. i would have expected him to move on to another question. instead  he just gave up and ended the interview. i found it unfair to gauge someone s knowledge by asking one question when there is an entire ocean of other equally relevant cs topics to touch upon. all in all  an opportunity lost because of the interviewer s mood impatience ,1. say there are a bunch of records  either photos news feed videos  to be displayed as feed on a mobile app  how would you improve the performance of such an interface 2. implement bus event design pattern   answer question

2015-05-29 18:41:18.43,i had a phone screen which was a live coding exercise on something aligned with my specialty. i was surprised by the exercise because it was somehow theoretical  but there was no trick question and it wasn t overly difficult. the interviewer would have been ok with me looking up documentation but my internet connection being really bad  i just went ahead and explained my process. i had very rapid feedback on that interview. in fact  the next time i checked my phone after doing the screen i was already invited to an onsite. on site i had 5 interviews. overall  the interviews were much more about high level process and thinking than coding proper. other reviews i read  and the recruiters email  prepared me to code on my computer  and again having access to documentation if needs be . in total  i had 2 functional brainstorming sessions ie how would you solve this problem   with problems squarely in my specialty. i had other exercises where i was asked the same but with a technical problem that was pretty different from what i usually do  and for which i had to write pseudocode  on white board . in my first interview  i had some trivial coding questions. i also had a more discussion type interview about values  past experience  etc. i must say it s not easy to get a sense of what are uber values culture from the website. so i just tried to be true to myself and show what i do care about. my last interview had more classic interview problems on white board. i did 3 exercises which were mostly on the fine points of javascript syntax and structure. those were not easy especially towards the end of the day. all in all i was surprised that questions stayed mostly high level  that made me more comfortable as i feel strongest there.,something something javascript   nda   2 answers

2015-04-24 21:09:33.09,interviewing with uber was definitely the most pleasant experience i ve ever had. to describe it in one word  it was concise. it was shorter than most interviews i ve been to  but at the same time the questions were right to the point and there was virtually no overlap from interviewer to interviewer. i thought the questions were very reasonable. it was not a stressful experience at all. the questions weren t necessarily hard  but they were very intentionally broad vague such that you had the opportunity to go as deep as you wanted in the interview. there were no riddle like questions  ones that were trivially easy once you knew the solution but would otherwise be difficult . this was a good thing and much appreciated. everyone i met was really nice and they all seemed like really cool people to me. i left the interview very much hoping that an offer would be extended  so all in all i d say they did an excellent job. furthermore  i think the recruiter was on point. this person was extremely prompt  and i generally moved from one part of the hiring process to the next with just one day of turnover. it left me feeling like the company actually cared about me and wanted to hire me. after the interview when we talked compensation  i told them my current salary and what i was hoping for with a job transition. the offer they made i felt was very generous and met my expectations  and i believed the recruiter when i was told that uber was trying its best to accommodate my requests. i made no counter offer  from what i d read on glassdoor already i didn t think they d budge on salary  and rsu s were generous  especially given uber s current state and growth. i also found out they give bonuses  so i was less concerned about what their initial offer was composed of.,i can t disclose the specific questions asked   answer question

2015-07-07 17:38:33.803,i was contacted by a recruiter asking me to interview. in the initial phone screen we spoke for 30 minutes about my resume and they emailed that day to ask for a follow up with a technical person over the phone. the phone interview was an hour long collaborative coding session with a programmer who asked me to solve a sorting problem. it wasn t difficult and we talked about the solution while i was coding. the focus was on me having something that compiled and ran. he was enthusiastic and polite. it was a positive experience. i was asked to come in for a longer interview of 4 technical parts and a meeting with one of the managers. i was asked to bring a laptop  but i don t have one so we organised that they would provide one preloaded with an ide for coding. for each technical part there were two interviewers. each started the same   they introduced themselves and asked a generic  tell us what you ve been doing   i was surprised none of them asked specifics about my resume  knew what i d been working on  or drilled down into anything i said. i got the impression none of them had seen my resume and didn t care about previous experience. given that  i wish i had paid more attention to the time and prepared an elevator pitch about myself so that i could have spent more time focused on the technical part. it was immediately obvious that in many cases the interviewers had no idea how to conduct an interview either solo or with a colleague. i was frequently given conflicting instructions from the two interviewers  or told to ignore something the other had said and answer a different question instead. at times they talked insistently and loudly over the top of each other. for the coding session despite organizing to have a laptop waiting for me it wasn t provided and the interviewer strongly rebuked me for not having brought my own. when i mentioned organizing one with the recruiter they knew nothing about it. i ended up coding on the interviewer s laptop in a basic text editor on an unfamiliar keyboard. there was no focus on actual output at all and i couldn t spend much time sitting down writing code because i kept being asked to answer questions on the whiteboard. in a later session i was asked the question and started brainstorming a solution with some pseudo code on the whiteboard. i was instantly rebuked  what do you think you re doing  you re not going to be able to solve this using a function.  later while i was working through the code i mentioned an edge case to check and the interviewers were lost why you should check at all  then got annoyed when i explained that checking edge cases was something you should do. there was a consistent theme of elitism and  we know better than you  with the interviewer s attitudes. one person introduced himself with just  hi. i ve been on this team for 6 months. before this i was at google.  another made sure to mention the ivy league college they d attended. my last session was 1 1 . after  tell me what you ve been doing   he asked  why do you want to work at uber   i started to talk about things i d been doing at my current job and how i was no longer challenged. he interrupted me with a disgusted look.  i asked  why you want to work at uber   not  why you don t want to work at your current workplace  . i explained i was doing that and continued with how from my experiences i had learned i was interested in things like cutting edge tech  big data  etc. and i felt i could get that at uber. i talked about how i like what they do and how great it is. he then deadpanned  so i m getting you like technology  and you like uber.  i was a little stunned at his attitude  but i honestly believe they have a great product so i elaborated more on why i thought uber was doing good things. he tried to justify his question   i m an engineering manager and my success is based on the success of my team members  so i want to know what s going to keep you here in 4 years  time   i was confused so i asked  4 years   he said  yes  what s to stop you from just packing up and leaving in 4 years  time   i wondered if he was being deliberately difficult in order to see how i would react. after explaining i didn t know what he was implying he asked if i had any questions for him. i asked several in depth questions about the work they were doing  technical aspects  etc. but he was done and just wanted to leave. he turned side on to me and faced the door  kept looking at his watch and out the window and giving short  dismissive answers. the recruiter turned up slightly after that and he left. during the day  no one said to me  here s why we want you to come work here and where we see you contributing . no one said  here s why you should

2014-12-20 13:27:58.317,while i d love to tell the exact questions i was asked  i am sure i ve signed an nda  and also every interview is different. i ll try to be as informative as possible though. was referred by a buddy to his team  and the initial process took a little longer  about two weeks  partly due to the recruiter not reaching out immediately and that i put things off since i was busy during that period of time. the phone interview was on filling in code for an existing interface in the mobile framework  which is a not the easiest thing to do since we rely heavily on the editor to auto complete most of the time. the interviewwe was very nice and didn t dwell too much on syntax. the interviewer went into a deeper discussion about the code i just wrote  including why i think the framework was implemented the way it was  and various follow up questions about this particularly feature. the interviewer was quite helpful and offered more detailed explanations of the answers he was looking for throughout the interview. a day later the recruiter called with positive feedback and wanted to to move to onsite. i was given options of completing a coding challenge at home or onsite  an easier version of the take home i assume . i chose the take home for obvious reasons  but told him that i was going be very busy over the next few days. i eventually around to it and spent about 4 5 hours on it before submitting  after which i was knocking my head on the wall after realizing i had bugs and what not. also i was unsure of how polished it was suppose to be  and tried to adhere to the 4 hour guideline  which we all know is not a lot of time to do anything. two days later the recruiter called back to move onto the onsite. the feedback was that overall i did well on the coding challenge  with some problems  e.g. not demonstrating understanding of mvc  bugs  etc   but those problems will be addressed once i go in person. interviewees are given  200 in uber credits to get to and from the interview  which i didn t use as it wasn t enough giving the limitations. once there  i was put into a room  which every interview complained to be very cold  for 5 one hour interviews. compared to other interviews i ve done in the past  i felt that the uber interview was the most effective at gauging the domain knowledge as well as programming skills of a candidate   as opposed to most other places where the questions asked are not relevant to the domain  and in the case of places like google  completely not related to one s expertise. during the interviews  i was asked to  1  fix bugs and add to the project i submitted for the coding challenge  and defend my implementation with a bunch of follow up questions related to optimization 2  answer a ton of questions on the mobile framework that tested for both breadth and depth of knowledge  not sure how i came up with some of those answers  3  code algorithm involving implementation and use of two data structures  was unfamiliar with the second one and had to figure it out on the spot  4  oop design question  hardest one for me by far as the interviewer wanted a completely modularized design  5  design discussion  very interesting as the interview was a debate and i wasn t sure what the interviewer was looking for  one day later  the recruiter called to make an offer. i want to mention that the uber recruiter was very professional and moved very fast  this is not true in many case elsewhere . useful feedback was also given that allowed me to better prepare for the next stage. i was very satisfied working with him and at no point in time felt i like i was left hanging.,design a casino game   answer question

2015-04-14 17:53:40.68,i interviewed a few months ago for a full time software engineer position at uber. i got the interview opportunity through friend referral. i was first scheduled for one round of phone screening that was given by an engineering manager of uber. was asked about my technical background  my work  as well as two coding problems. it went very well and i was invited for onsite interview one hour after the phone call. the onsite interview occurred 2 weeks later and last about 4.5 hours. 4 people challenged me with many technical questions such as whiteboard coding and system design questions. every one was pretty friendly and walked in quite on time so there was not much break time in between. last technical interview was a practical one   i was asked to solve a real world problem and implemented it subsequently. before the actual coding work  interviewer had a thorough discussion with me on details of all levels to make sure it was a reasonable solution that could be done in a matter of minutes. the problem wasn t super hard and the solution could be suboptimal but you need to make it work. therefore you better be a hands on engineer at work and write real code in an efficient way  editor choice  api lookup  debugging skills  etc . for myself i use vim everyday and that helped me a lot. following the 4th round of technical interview i also got the chance to talk to recruiter and hiring manager for various questions and concerns  which they addressed very well. i got an offer next day after the onsite interview which after some negotiation i happily accepted. one thing i d like to point out is that i was blown away by the company s efficiency during the whole hiring process. the hiring manager and a few recruiters i worked with always responded very promptly within a few minutes. btw i live in south bay and the commuting to from san francisco was of course covered using uber  making the interview experience even more pleasant  ,whiteboard coding  live coding  design  culture questions that kind of stuff   answer question

2013-11-19 20:12:06.187,the hiring process is kinda messy  but the people there including recruiters seem very nice  so they are making efforts to make things work. the team hire structure can be hit or miss  interviewers are less prepared  nothing ensures a consistent high bar. less of getting talents more of filling the positions. the offer making process really shows the philosophy of the company. people are hired for working on tasks  not to help building a great company. very much a top down structure than eng driven like google. seems that engs are just expected to follow orders  not to think or improve. the stock option is offered without mentioning the current fair market value  only throwing big potential growth  red flag 1  getting arrogant and cold when trying to negotiate  red flag 2. if future employees are not treated with respect  hard to imagine how things would be when actually working there.,find the longest word in a grid of random letter  each consecutive letters has to be next to the previous one.   answer question

2013-09-30 15:58:35.3,i interviewed at uber because they are an impressive company and probably a great place to work. i didn t receive and offer. i cannot say that i was surprised. i do believe there were a few things they could have done better to increase my chances as well as to treat their candidates better. as others have mentioned  they encourage their candidates to handle a coding challenge. while this is not unreasonable  they did not set clear expectations. specifically  if you are invited on site  they will carefully review your submission in person. i might have performed better at the interview if i didn t have to admit so many areas for improvement in my submission. had i been aware that my code would be part of the interview  i probably would have done a better job. this is something to be aware of because they failed to mention it prior to my submission. otherwise  the interviews were tough and tiring. the questions were somewhat less structured than many other companies. the office seemed quite disorganized. i doubt it s always like that  but it did appear that i was invited at an especially hectic time  both at the office and in the neighborhood outside. i might have benefited from them inviting me at a more reasonable time. the recruiter had rushed me through the whole process. maybe i would have been more prepared if i hadn t allowed this to happen. finally  they repeatedly volunteered to pay to reimburse my transportation costs and then failed to do so. it wasn t a significant amount  but it was more than i have spent anywhere else. the only reason i splurged was that  with no suggestion of my own  the recruiter volunteered to cover the costs multiple times. of course  after i was rejected i was not reimbursed. it s an easy empty promise to make.,a lot of javascript related   answer question

2013-12-22 18:27:22.56,had an initial call with a recruiter who wanted to gauge my understanding of uber s business model and interest in the company. then had a phone call with the hiring manager before coming in for four onsite interviews. the interviewers all spent a good amount of time getting to know me before moving on to the technical portion  which was mostly coding on a whiteboard. things were a bit hectic when i interviewed   uber had outgrown the office and interviews were done in a quiet corner. also  the list of interviewers changed quite a bit. another notable thing was uber was the only company that asked how i handle stress. all signs of rapid growth  but not necessarily a bad thing.,how do you handle stress    answer question
2013-07-25 17:03:34.683,i applied on their website and had a call with a recruiter within a week. the next day he asked me to do a coding challenge. i spent the weekend doing it and within a day of sending it to them  they said i had impressed them with my work and asked me to fly to sf for a final round. note that i had to book my own flight and hotel and i didn t get reimbursed until two weeks later. not a big deal but be prepared to front about  1 000 if you re coming from the east coast on such short notice. the onsite wasn t very organized  people stepped in and out. i met with all engineers  besides a brief chat with the recruiter   in total about 8   10 people. i know for a fact i didn t do well on one interview. the interviewer had a very strong european accent and i also answered one of his questions wrong. he even laughed at me  which i thought was extremely rude. i did well on all the other interviews throughout the day. a week later i got a rejection email saying that they liked my passion but didn t think i had enough python experience. very much a canned rejection email.,pretend i am a 5 year old and explain what an np complete problem is.   1 answer
2013-09-21 18:44:29.163,i was contacted by a recruiter via linkedin who was looking for a backend developer  i informed her that wasn t my speciality but if they were looking for  insert speciality here  i d be happy to talk to them. she passed me off to another recruiter who set me up with a call with the hiring manager. call with hiring manager mostly covered non technical topics  largely about how my speciality might fit in at uber. after that i had an onsite interview scheduled. the onsite was a technically rigorous interview with three sessions  it reminded me of the google style interview process. some whiteboard coding  lots of discussions about how my speciality could fit in at uber and a lot of sysadmin style technology questions. everyone i met was really pleasant and very smart. i got a call just under a week later saying that they i had done well but weren t convinced that i had demonstrated sufficient software engineering skills  outside my speciality  and asked if i could do a take home coding test. i finished the test in a handful of hours over two evenings and got it back to them. from the sounds of things the code test normally happens before the onsite interview. a few days after that i heard that they wanted to make an offer. at this point i was also waiting for an offer from another company and told them so and asked for some time. the recruiter was happy to give me time to consider other offers and went through the offer in some detail. the offer was a good  but not amazing  salary plus stock options  the stock options were worth almost as much as the salary at the present valuation of the company  according to the recruiter . the story takes an unexpected detour here as my other offer is delayed due to problems at the other company. the recruiter was very understanding but grew a little frustrated as the delay turned into a multiple week saga. eventually the other company made an offer that had a similar salary component but a much larger equity component. it was a hard choice but i was more interested in the market segment of the other company so i declined uber s offer. everyone i met at uber was great and i would have been delighted to work there.,please find our standard web test below  code test  bam  uber clients are able to store favorite locations for easy pickup requests. create a backend and a frontend for managing favorite locations. this is a simple exercise  but organize  design and test your code as if it were going into production. when you re done  host it somewhere and provide us with a url and a tarball or git repo with the code. backend using the language  python preferred   libraries and data store of your choosing  create a json in out restful api for managing favorite locations. stay away from django or rails  but microframeworks like flask  preferred   sinatra or express are fine. attributes of a favorite location object include  id  lat  lng  address  e.g. 800 market street  san francisco  ca 94114   name  e.g. work  frontend using javascript  backbone.js and any other libraries of your choosing  create an interface to access the api. user should be able to  create a new location read view a location  and a collection of all locations update an existing location delete a location the ux is up to you  with a couple of constraints  incorporate a map geocode the address so the user is not required to enter lat lng extras if you like  get creative and do whatever else you like on the backend and or frontend to show off.   1 answer
2013-04-24 18:48:30.1,i was referred to uber by an acquaintance. after a standard phone screen  i was asked to complete a coding exercise that would take 6 8 hours. while i approve of coding exercises as an interviewing technique  a working day is a rather large time commitment so early in an interviewing process. i politely responded that i would like to see how my other interviews  which were much further along  conclude before completing the exercise. i received a rather rude and terse response from the in house recruiter   doesn t sound like we are the right fit for what you are looking for.  i m happy that i did not interview further.,the take home challenge was good   emphasis here is on owning a full stack for a service  and this was the first time i had written an api using flask.   answer question
