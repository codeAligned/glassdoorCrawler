The interview is ok in general. But I am really DISAPPOINTED by their onsite interview policy. Uber doesn't take care of your trip, you have to book the flight, hotel and car by yourself, and pay them yourself. The recruiter promised to reimburse the trip expense, and I submitted my reimburse report to their AP department. I DID NOT get my reimbursement back and they stopped answering my emails. Uber should have a standard travel reimbursement policy.

Time to explore new opportunities, so I submitted my resume to a few top Valley companies and startups including Uber. Got contacted by the recruiter a few days later after my online submisson. 1) Recruiter initial phone call. (30 mins) 2) TPS (1 hour) You need to solve the coding exercise via online code sharing editor. Some follow-up discussions. 3) Take home code challenge. I spent a weekend on building the solution and making sure I like what I submitted. I got feedback next day. Amazing efficiency. 4) 4 onsite interviews (4 - 5 hours) at Uber HQ. Jam with a group of Uber engineers, plus a nice onsite lunch break. Each interview is designed with 2 engineers except the Culture fit one which is a product discussion with one of the engineering managers. I did some coding questions on my laptop. 5) Wrap up with my recruiter. All questions are reasonable. Marked the interview as difficult in the sense that you definitely want to be well prepared. There were quite a few problems I never saw before. Know your stuffs well -- you should be OK. The interview process is very smooth. I have no issue with my onsite travel reimbursement, although it took ~3 weeks to get it completed. I got a call in the next one or two days after my onsite with an offer! The package is excellent. I chose Uber over other offers/opportunities because I really believe in Uber's mission that is happening in an incredible scale. And all the engineers I met are super cool, sharp and resourceful.

The initial process was incredibly great. I submitted my application for the internship online and received a reply within 3 hours. The next steps took a ridiculous amount of time. First, they said that once I told them a time that I was available for interview, that I must be able to make it or the interview would be canceled. However, what made things worse was that the interviewer canceled the phone interview by sending an email, within an hour of the interview, twice. This entire process took 6 weeks. No interview. I'm done with this company. You should save your time and apply somewhere else. (P.s. I applied to the New York office)

I was referred by a friend and set up with a phone screen with the technical recruiter within a few days of the referral. It was a brief fifteen-minute conversation, and the recruiter scheduled a tech screen with an engineer afterwards. During this tech screen, the interviewer asked me to solve one coding challenge through a pair programming module. I completed it, then made sure to solve for edge cases, and then asked some questions at the end. My interviewer seemed rushed for time, since he ended the conversation right on time and left with an abrupt "goodbye!". I received a rejection within 48 hours, but knew exactly what I messed up on and definitely can't blame the interviewer -- he was very helpful in delivering feedback at the end of the interview.

Processes started with recruiter emailing me and we went over details about the team and other opportunities they have and I went through different roles and fixed on one and reached out to start the process. I had a phone screen interview with a senior engineer on team, basic datastructure and algorithm coding problem, as that went well, I got email in next 30 min asking for onsite interview dates and scheduled this a week after. I went onsite and met with the whole team. Interview was above average, had tough questions on design and architecture, but nothing that I didn't do in my past roles, so I felt comfortable. You should really know all your basics and running times and space complexities to come up with feasible solution for the design questions. Most questions include lot of aspects, not just simple datastructure and algorithms. I was very happy with the team and they were too (because I got offer). I got a call next day that I got offer, I got offer details a day later. I have to compromise on some stuff, but overall I was happy with offer, so I took it.

Got called by the recruiter. Scheduled the technical phone interview soon after. The process was quick and smooth. The interview was focused mainly on mobile architecture. I've done mobile development in the past but wasn't too familiar with architecture details, so faltered a bit while answering. This was followed by a question on a design pattern. I had never heard of this pattern before. I took my time to understand the question with some help from the interviewer. He was quickly frustrated within 3-4 minutes and told me he was looking for developers with better coding skills. I disagree that I have bad coding skills just because I couldn't answer the question without frustrating the guy. Also, he should have understood that it's really hard for someone to implement a design pattern if they have never heard of it before. I would have expected him to move on to another question. Instead, he just gave up and ended the interview. I found it unfair to gauge someone's knowledge by asking one question when there is an entire ocean of other equally relevant CS topics to touch upon. All in all, an opportunity lost because of the interviewer's mood/impatience!

Applied online and was contacted by a recruiter the next day. I went through two technical phone interviews, each with a pair of engineers. The questions were fairly straight-forward. Some implementation questions, software architecture, and algorithm design. After going through the first two interviews, I was informed by the recruiter that they wanted me to speak with a manager (it was not explicitly a technical). I then had a third phone interview scheduled with the recruiter. Over the course of the next week, the recruiter changed the time and manager on me five times before settling down on a date and person. By the time the third interview rolled around, I got called by a manager who wasn't the one I was scheduled to talk to. This manager seemed unprepared and was unaware of the position I wanted to take at the company (mobile development, more geared towards UI). This manager completely dismissed my design work and delved straight into a machine learning question (i never stated i had experience in this field). I was asked a few questions about how to improve an aspect of the Uber service. I responded with some naive answers about device-device communications, to which he shot down immediately and went deep into a machine learning topic. The next day I was informed they would pick a different candidate.

Uber has a very simple hiring process: Step 1) Technical Phone Interview Step 2) Interview in our SF office Step 3) Offer! I didn't understand the problem well during phone interview and spent 30 minutes coming up with a solution that wasn't doing the right thing. After communicating with interviewer, he was nice enough to go over time with me and I finally got it done. (The phone call lasted for 75 minutes) Recruiter got back to me quickly telling me that feedback was great. Then on-site interview was scheduled. There was a three-week gap between phone and onsite but I finally interviewed at SF. Everyone I met was nice and approachable. They patiently listened to me explaining my thinking process and provide feedback along the way. Two days after the interview I received phone call from HR telling me that they decide to extend an offer. Enjoyed the process.

The interview process was short and sweet, one of the best interview processes I have ever had. The questions were challenging and fun but straight to the point (no hidden agenda). However I believe some questions were intentionally broad to see if you could bring in some design/architecture as well. Prepare and be confident

Algorithms, Data structure design, database design, load balancing, modeling, server-side design. Very comprehensive interview with an emphasis on end to end knowledge. Your designs and CS fundamentals should be strong, but with good and smart preparation you should be fine. Its really your job to lose.

I had a phone screen which was a live coding exercise on something aligned with my specialty. I was surprised by the exercise because it was somehow theoretical, but there was no trick question and it wasn't overly difficult. the interviewer would have been ok with me looking up documentation but my internet connection being really bad, I just went ahead and explained my process. I had very rapid feedback on that interview. In fact, the next time I checked my phone after doing the screen I was already invited to an onsite. On site i had 5 interviews. Overall, the interviews were much more about high level process and thinking than coding proper. Other reviews I read, and the recruiters email, prepared me to code on my computer (and again having access to documentation if needs be). In total, I had 2 functional brainstorming sessions ie how would you solve this problem - with problems squarely in my specialty. I had other exercises where I was asked the same but with a technical problem that was pretty different from what I usually do, and for which I had to write pseudocode (on white board). In my first interview, I had some trivial coding questions. I also had a more discussion type interview about values, past experience, etc. I must say it's not easy to get a sense of what are uber values/culture from the website. So I just tried to be true to myself and show what I do care about. My last interview had more classic interview problems on white board. I did 3 exercises which were mostly on the fine points of javascript syntax and structure. Those were not easy especially towards the end of the day. All in all I was surprised that questions stayed mostly high level, that made me more comfortable as I feel strongest there.

I replied to a linked-in email from the recruiter about a newly opened Seattle office and expressed my interest. After the phone call with the recruiter, I got scheduled for a technical 45-minute phone screen. I was extremely nervous and managed to bomb both behavior part of the screen and the coding portion too, so no surprises I was promptly rejected. What can be improved: a recruiter could have set clearer expectations for the interview (e.g. that there will be significant non-technical portion). As is I failed to showcase any of my abilities and as the result, had a terrible experience as a candidate.

Interviewing with Uber was definitely the most pleasant experience I've ever had. To describe it in one word, it was concise. It was shorter than most interviews I've been to, but at the same time the questions were right to the point and there was virtually no overlap from interviewer to interviewer. I thought the questions were very reasonable. It was not a stressful experience at all. The questions weren't necessarily hard, but they were very intentionally broad/vague such that you had the opportunity to go as deep as you wanted in the interview. There were no riddle-like questions (ones that were trivially easy once you knew the solution but would otherwise be difficult). This was a good thing and much appreciated. Everyone I met was really nice and they all seemed like really cool people to me. I left the interview very much hoping that an offer would be extended, so all in all I'd say they did an excellent job. Furthermore, I think the recruiter was on point. This person was extremely prompt, and I generally moved from one part of the hiring process to the next with just one day of turnover. It left me feeling like the company actually cared about me and wanted to hire me. After the interview when we talked compensation, I told them my current salary and what I was hoping for with a job transition. The offer they made I felt was very generous and met my expectations, and I believed the recruiter when I was told that Uber was trying its best to accommodate my requests. I made no counter-offer; from what I'd read on Glassdoor already I didn't think they'd budge on salary, and RSU's were generous, especially given Uber's current state and growth. I also found out they give bonuses, so I was less concerned about what their initial offer was composed of.

The interviewer's coding question wasn't too difficult, but he was very good at pushing you and assessing your ability to communicate.

Overview: * Referred by a friend. * Contacted by a recruiter. Phone call for 30 minutes. * Phone interview. * Onsite. * Offer. * A bit of negotiation. * Accepted. Phone interview: I took the phone interview at home before going to work. My interviewer was nice and friendly. I used coder-pad to solve the problem. He was very helpful. I had a bug in my code, and he stirred me in the right direction to debug without giving it away. I figured it out eventually. Afterwards I emailed him with some questions regarding Uber's culture, and I asked how it is different from a tech tech company since it's more of a business tech company. He answered my questions in details and I was very impressed by how much effort he put into it. Onsite: 4 technical interviews (2 white-board coding questions, 1 system design, 1 live coding). Each interview was conducted by 2 engineers. One engineer was the main facilitator the other one just watched and jumped in whenever. It is a bit intimidating to be honest. But I made sure to make eye contact to both interviewers. They were all helpful. A couple of them had a serious look on their faces. In general they were pleasantto talk to. Questions were moderate to difficult, so manage your time wisely! The last interview with the hiring manager was more of a culture fit interview. Offer: I received a verbal offer the next morning, and I was very excited because I really liked Uber to begin with. Plus I have some friends there and they all enjoy being there. After a bit of negotiation I happily accepted the offer, and started working mid May. Other notes: * The whole process (from referral to offer) was very streamlined, efficient. * People that work here are very passionate about Uber. That's something I was looking for in a new job.

I was contacted by a recruiter asking me to interview. In the initial phone screen we spoke for 30 minutes about my resume and they emailed that day to ask for a follow up with a technical person over the phone. The phone interview was an hour long collaborative coding session with a programmer who asked me to solve a sorting problem. It wasn’t difficult and we talked about the solution while I was coding. The focus was on me having something that compiled and ran. He was enthusiastic and polite. It was a positive experience. I was asked to come in for a longer interview of 4 technical parts and a meeting with one of the managers. I was asked to bring a laptop, but I don’t have one so we organised that they would provide one preloaded with an IDE for coding. For each technical part there were two interviewers. Each started the same – they introduced themselves and asked a generic “tell us what you’ve been doing?” I was surprised none of them asked specifics about my resume, knew what I’d been working on, or drilled down into anything I said. I got the impression none of them had seen my resume and didn’t care about previous experience. Given that, I wish I had paid more attention to the time and prepared an elevator pitch about myself so that I could have spent more time focused on the technical part. It was immediately obvious that in many cases the interviewers had no idea how to conduct an interview either solo or with a colleague. I was frequently given conflicting instructions from the two interviewers, or told to ignore something the other had said and answer a different question instead. At times they talked insistently and loudly over the top of each other. For the coding session despite organizing to have a laptop waiting for me it wasn’t provided and the interviewer strongly rebuked me for not having brought my own. When I mentioned organizing one with the recruiter they knew nothing about it. I ended up coding on the interviewer’s laptop in a basic text editor on an unfamiliar keyboard. There was no focus on actual output at all and I couldn’t spend much time sitting down writing code because I kept being asked to answer questions on the whiteboard. In a later session I was asked the question and started brainstorming a solution with some pseudo-code on the whiteboard. I was instantly rebuked “what do you think you’re doing? You’re not going to be able to solve this using a function.” Later while I was working through the code I mentioned an edge case to check and the interviewers were lost why you should check at all, then got annoyed when I explained that checking edge cases was something you should do. There was a consistent theme of elitism and “we know better than you” with the interviewer’s attitudes. One person introduced himself with just “Hi. I’ve been on this team for 6 months. Before this I was at Google.” Another made sure to mention the Ivy League college they’d attended. My last session was 1:1 . After "tell me what you’ve been doing?” he asked “why do you want to work at Uber?” I started to talk about things I’d been doing at my current job and how I was no longer challenged. He interrupted me with a disgusted look. “I asked *why you want to work at Uber*, not *why you don’t want to work at your current workplace*”. I explained I was doing that and continued with how from my experiences I had learned I was interested in things like cutting edge tech, big data, etc. and I felt I could get that at Uber. I talked about how I like what they do and how great it is. He then deadpanned “so I’m getting you like technology, and you like Uber.” I was a little stunned at his attitude, but I honestly believe they have a great product so I elaborated more on why I thought Uber was doing good things. He tried to justify his question, “I’m an engineering manager and my success is based on the success of my team members, so I want to know what’s going to keep you here in 4 years’ time?” I was confused so I asked “4 years?” He said “yes, what’s to stop you from just packing up and leaving in 4 years’ time?” I wondered if he was being deliberately difficult in order to see how I would react. After explaining I didn’t know what he was implying he asked if I had any questions for him. I asked several in-depth questions about the work they were doing, technical aspects, etc. but he was done and just wanted to leave. He turned side on to me and faced the door, kept looking at his watch and out the window and giving short, dismissive answers. The recruiter turned up slightly after that and he left. During the day, no one said to me “here’s why we want you to come work here and where we see you contributing”. No one said “here’s why you should be here instead of Amazon, or Google, or Facebook”, and no one said “we have a great team here, it’s an amazing environment and we love working here every day”. Overall a horrible experience.

The process included a phone screen by a recruiter, a google hangout with 2 engineers and an in person interview with 4 pairs of engineers. The questions were different than other interviews I've been in with this structure. In the other interviews the questions were more towards algorithm and problem solving, these ones were open ended architecture questions. I definitely prefer the more open ended architecture questions. All of the interviewers were pleasant with the exception of one. I was struggling to communicate my answer, and the interviewer was openly frustrated (first time I've seen this happen, I've interviewed with this structure at 3 other companies). Even to a point of sighing out loud in frustration. Uber expressed that the interview was to simulate a regular work day, and in my opinion this would have been unprofessional in a meeting, but maybe at Uber this is normal? My opinion may also stem from the fact that I have never worked at start ups with a very young engineering culture. I was excited to be given the chance to interview at Uber but after the interview it was clear I didn't fit in with the culture.

I was contacted by an Uber recruiter on LinkedIn with a personalized email. I then did a recruiter phone screen, and then a technical phone screen. The next week I came in for a full day of interviews. I had to code an Android app in the interview, which was pretty cool and I think a good test of my engineering skills. Everyone was super friendly and I got to eat lunch with one of the Android teams. I had a great experience. After the interview the recruiter stayed in contact and worked with me to accept my offer. I went back to Uber several teams to meet with engineers to answer my questions about culture and just hangout.

Initially, I was supposed to have two interview, but I ended up having three (all phone interviews). First interview, was asked about my background and to explain a project. Then, was asked a technical question. I was contacted within 10 minutes of the interview completing for a second round interview. Had a second interview a week later in which I talked to a Development Manager. Again, was asked about my background and then to explain how I think the Uber product works and how it could be improved. Then, asked an open-ended OOD question. E-mailed my recruiter 3 days after to ask about feedback and she responded within a couple hours asking to set up one more interview. In my final interview, went straight into my coding question (OOD and implementation) and went over in time a little. Was contacted within 10 minutes to set up a time to talk the next day and received my offer.

I was contacted by a recruiter via email to schedule a technical phone interview. The recruiter also sent me a list of Software Engineering positions that were available and a description of the languages/technologies I would need to know. This was helpful in preparing for the interview. The interviewer contacted me on time. It started with an introduction and a couple questions about my resume. Then the coding portion of the interview began. I had about 20 minutes to complete it. It was a fairly challenging question that tested your knowledge of OOP principles. I struggled a bit, but the interviewer kindly walked me through the parts where I was making mistakes. Overall, it was a great experience. Although my interview process with Uber ended at this point, I learned a lot and I'll be able to use this experience to improve.

I got an internal referral through an employee. I got contacted by HR very quickly and set up a phone screen. During my phone screen, I was contacted by an engineer who was different from the person initially scheduled to call me. I point this out because he was a javascript engineer while I was interviewing for a backend position. The engineer called 10 minutes late to a 45 minute interview. Then he proceeded to ask me about my background and dived into a coding question.

He asked me a question that seemed very applicable to a javascript engineer, but just didn't make sense to ask if I wanted to code in java. It seemed like very quickly the engineer realized that he didn't think his question through, but it was too late at that point. Therefore for the next 30 minutes I proceeded to attempt to answer a question that was poorly constructed and just wasn't applicable. On top of this, the interviewer was in a very loud room with a lot of background noise so it was very difficult to hear from. Also he was constantly talking to another engineer that was also on the call with me, with who I imagine he was trying to get advice on how to improve the question. Additionally the call quality became very poor halfway through the interview and I pretty much could not understand anything he was saying. All in all, this was a very poor experience and I hope HR improves their interview process in the future.   Answer Question

The process was in 2 steps: a live coding phone screen, and an onsite. I was initially concerned about the live coding process due to bad experiences with other companies in the past, but the interview blew my expectations. It was clear that the interviewer was concerned with getting a good assessment of my abilities rather than nit pick on silly syntax. The onsite was a bit unique and included 2 problem solving sessions, 1 live coding, and 1 design section. I really enjoyed the problem solving sessions and we worked out a few very interesting problems together with the interviewers. For design section, I was asked to design a system from scratch and talk about scaling, product, and performance concerns.

Started off with a few calls with the recruiter, then got set up with a technical phone interview with one of the engineers. The question was pretty easy, any fool that knows how to code should get it. Then I was called for an on-site interview. There were a couple of easy technical questions, and a lot of them wanted to discuss a problem I solved or what I do at my current job. So in the end, I had to explain my work like 3 freaking times to 3 different people, which is probably my fault for talking about the same thing, I probably should've prepared different problems to talk about.

While I'd love to tell the exact questions I was asked, I am sure I've signed an NDA, and also every interview is different. I'll try to be as informative as possible though. Was referred by a buddy to his team, and the initial process took a little longer (about two weeks) partly due to the recruiter not reaching out immediately and that I put things off since I was busy during that period of time. The phone interview was on filling in code for an existing interface in the mobile framework, which is a not the easiest thing to do since we rely heavily on the editor to auto complete most of the time. The interviewwe was very nice and didn't dwell too much on syntax. The interviewer went into a deeper discussion about the code I just wrote, including why I think the framework was implemented the way it was, and various follow up questions about this particularly feature. The interviewer was quite helpful and offered more detailed explanations of the answers he was looking for throughout the interview. A day later the recruiter called with positive feedback and wanted to to move to onsite. I was given options of completing a coding challenge at home or onsite (an easier version of the take home I assume). I chose the take home for obvious reasons, but told him that I was going be very busy over the next few days. I eventually around to it and spent about 4-5 hours on it before submitting, after which I was knocking my head on the wall after realizing I had bugs and what not. Also I was unsure of how polished it was suppose to be, and tried to adhere to the 4 hour guideline, which we all know is not a lot of time to do anything. Two days later the recruiter called back to move onto the onsite. The feedback was that overall I did well on the coding challenge, with some problems (e.g. not demonstrating understanding of MVC, bugs, etc), but those problems will be addressed once I go in person. Interviewees are given $200 in Uber credits to get to and from the interview, which I didn't use as it wasn't enough giving the limitations. Once there, I was put into a room (which every interview complained to be very cold) for 5 one-hour interviews. Compared to other interviews I've done in the past, I felt that the Uber interview was the most effective at gauging the domain knowledge as well as programming skills of a candidate , as opposed to most other places where the questions asked are not relevant to the domain, and in the case of places like Google, completely not related to one's expertise. During the interviews, I was asked to: 1) fix bugs and add to the project I submitted for the coding challenge, and defend my implementation with a bunch of follow up questions related to optimization 2) answer a ton of questions on the mobile framework that tested for both breadth and depth of knowledge (not sure how I came up with some of those answers) 3) code algorithm involving implementation and use of two data structures (was unfamiliar with the second one and had to figure it out on the spot) 4) OOP design question (hardest one for me by far as the interviewer wanted a completely modularized design) 5) design discussion (very interesting as the interview was a debate and I wasn't sure what the interviewer was looking for) One day later, the recruiter called to make an offer. I want to mention that the Uber recruiter was very professional and moved very fast (This is not true in many case elsewhere). Useful feedback was also given that allowed me to better prepare for the next stage. I was very satisfied working with him and at no point in time felt I like I was left hanging.

Q:Why Uber?   Answer Question

Apr 14, 2015

I interviewed a few months ago for a full time software engineer position at Uber. I got the interview opportunity through friend referral. I was first scheduled for one round of phone screening that was given by an engineering manager of Uber. Was asked about my technical background, my work, as well as two coding problems. It went very well and I was invited for onsite interview one hour after the phone call. The onsite interview occurred 2 weeks later and last about 4.5 hours. 4 people challenged me with many technical questions such as whiteboard coding and system design questions. Every one was pretty friendly and walked in quite on time so there was not much break time in between. Last technical interview was a practical one - I was asked to solve a real world problem and implemented it subsequently. Before the actual coding work, interviewer had a thorough discussion with me on details of all levels to make sure it was a reasonable solution that could be done in a matter of minutes. The problem wasn't super hard and the solution could be suboptimal but you need to make it work. Therefore you better be a hands-on engineer at work and write real code in an efficient way (editor choice, API lookup, debugging skills, etc). For myself I use Vim everyday and that helped me a lot. Following the 4th round of technical interview I also got the chance to talk to recruiter and hiring manager for various questions and concerns, which they addressed very well. I got an offer next day after the onsite interview which after some negotiation I happily accepted. One thing I'd like to point out is that I was blown away by the company's efficiency during the whole hiring process. The hiring manager and a few recruiters I worked with always responded very promptly within a few minutes. BTW I live in South bay and the commuting to/from San Francisco was of course covered using Uber, making the interview experience even more pleasant:)

Hiring process was fairly standard - phone interviews, then on-site. The main problem I had with the interview was that my recruiter was the most unresponsive and uncommunicative person I had ever worked with. I go to school on the east coast, so they had to fly me into California. After the interviews were said and done, however, I declined their offer and then emailed my recruiter for travel reimbursements. Lo and behold, the recruiter who was extremely responsive to my emails did a complete 180 and starting ignoring completely. Weeks pass (I've written about 5 emails now), and there's still no word of reimbursement. I contact her through other means as well (LinkedIn), but again get no response. At this point, I'm scared that they won't reimburse me at all for the $400+ in travel fees. Finally, I emailed a random other recruiter through LinkedIn and was able to get a very speedy response. Watch out candidates, Uber is not the best when it comes to recruiting.

The most responsive interview process I've had. I applied for the position online and the technical recruiter reached back to me the next day. She asked about my background and I was given the choice of either submitting a code project I was proud of or completing a coding challenge within a week. I opted for the coding challenge and spent an entire weekend implementing it. I was then arranged a phone-screen with a senior software engineer. The phone interview was a live coding session and we had to implement a feature on the browser together. Later that day, I heard back from the recruiter and she invited me to fly to San Francisco from Toronto for an onsite interview. The onsite interview consisted of four separate rounds of 45-minute interviews. The first three rounds each had two engineers and I was asked to write working code and design on the whiteboard. Each round tested knowledge on a specific domain: in-depth coding, architecture design, breadth of knowledge. The last round was a design discussion with an engineering manager. I heard back from the recruiter the next morning and was presented with an offer.

Contacted the recruiter and soon got a phone call from the company. After 3 phone screens in the less than 10 days, I was scheduled for an onsite. They agreed to reimburse for the costs but since the interview they have been mute. The onsite interview was supposed to be with 5 people, but it was cut short to only 4. The excuse was that the final interviewer had something emergent came up. In hindsight it seems they already decided not to hire, even though I thought I did relatively well. Most of the interviewer seems very professional, except one, whose body language and facial expression was saying that I was wasting her time. The recruiter was silent after the interview until I pinged her for an update. She told me that I was not a fit because the team was looking for a very specific candidate. In hindsight, the statement from the recruiter and from some other reviewers cannot be more true: the company is looking for VERY SPECIFIC skill set and is not looking for anything remotely like a generalist. The position I applied for was in mapping and logistics and they seem to expect me to know all the algorithms in computational geometry. My friends who were hired by a different team in the company was hired because he knew exactly what the team was looking for. It looks like people were hired to solve problems that already have and not the ones that will come up in the future. In other words, the company's hiring demeanor is very short sighted.

Submitted resume, contacted by recruiter 2 months later (this is because I stupidly didn't tell a friend I was applying so I didn't get referred. If you know someone there, get a referral!). Had a phone interview with recruiter about what I'm looking for and experienced in. Skipped the technical phone interview because I knew people there, so I went straight to the on-site interview the next week. Technical interview was fair, not as difficult as I expected. I never claimed to be a pythonista as my experience is in C, but I can write python, so maybe they took it easy on me when I wrote some non-pythonic code. Coding questions included string manipulation and graph traversals, pretty simple code but enough to gauge your algorithmic knowledge. Had one design question. Technical questions included trivia about working in a terminal and core computer science or programming language fundamentals. Afterwards had an open ended discussion with the hiring manager (now my manager) about Uber's system architecture.

I had a recruiter reach out to me expressing interest in having me meet with the team. I did a phone screen with the hiring manager, a coding exercise, and then had a full day of on-site interviews. The hiring manager was very nice and enjoyable to speak with, however, the rest of the team was pretty awful. Folks would smirk when they didn't like your answer or thought they had "gotten your goat" so to speak. Another time I had an interviewer completely disinterested and checking his phone for minutes at a time while I was answering his questions. A lot of the folks hadn't looked at my resume before speaking with me and didn't have a copy when speaking with me. I've interviewed at quite a few companies over the course of my career and Uber is far and away the most unprofessional and worst experience I've had. You can sense they are growing quickly and potentially hiring bodies more than quality candidates. To add insult to injury, the Uber driver that brought me to the interview talked about how terrible Uber had gotten over the course of the few years he'd been a driver for them and somewhat eerily we passed under a sign on the freeway announcing an upcoming protest at the Uber office.

The most responsive and open interview process I have ever been involved with. From the very beginning I was given all star help and guidance. Began with a quick talk about the company and my background, aka the initial screening. This was followed by a coding challenge, unless I already had public code I preferred they look at. I enjoy a good challenge so I chose one of theirs: a full stack single page web application. After a week, I submitted and they had a single day turn around to review the entire project! The following day was a technical overview of my experiences. Later the SAME day, I was informed I was invited to an onsite at HQ. I was to front the bill for travel, but their expense reimbursements process is painless. They ultimately pay for everything. The onsite I will describe only as a pleasure and a challenge to respect their process.

Applied online through their career section. Immediately got call from HR (in an hour; They are pretty efficient). They asked if I have any open source projects that they can take a look at. I sent some of my open source code but they wanted to see some concrete. So they sent me coding exercise which I finished in a week (It was simple exercise developing web app). Again got call from HR the next day saying they liked it and wants to talk further. Had another phone interview with the engineer. It was very basic interview with questions like what are you working on, why are you looking to move etc. (nothing much technical). Then interviewer asked me if I am open to come for onsite interview. They scheduled onsite interview immediately. Onsite was tough with 3 technical interviews testing my coding skills. I know i didnt do well in 1 interview (some rude guy with european accent -- as someone said earlier about him in another review) but other 2 went all right. Next week got rejection email saying didnt meet the requirements. As far as company is concerned, it looks on the right path with lots of talented people around. But its not the best I have seen.

The process for Uber interview is pretty interesting. Unlike with Google or other big companies, besides white board coding and design questions, Uber has an extra round of living coding section. There you are given a real world problem and you need to solve it using your own computer, write the code, debug and then demo it in 45 minutes. You can use your preferred language, tools and even Google things you don't know during the interview. In this one, they actually test your ability to solving real problem and communication skills, not just about algorithm.

Pretty standard process. 1. Recruiter contacted me via LinkedIn, followed by short call covering the usual recruiter fluff. 2. One hour phone call/shared code window with team lead. 3. Full day onsite split into 1 hour segments 1-1 with team members to do a coding exercise on a whiteboard, and ask questions. Also, lunch with team. Questions focused mainly around computer science and system architecture (i.e. describing the algorithm rather than writing code, knowing the big-O complexity, etc.) 4. Canned rejection email from recruiter There were some common traits amongst the team. One of these was that they all graduated recently from the same two top engineering schools. They were friendly during lunch, but during the interview session there was a more serious tone - almost spite - as if to see how I handled having my competence questioned. Overall it was a well organized, thorough process. I would have taken an offer given the reputation of the company.

The phone screen is a 40 minute interview about the code you wrote. I got the feeling they were expecting a much more thorough job than the challenge suggests. In retrospect, I would have taken care of a lot more of my TODOs.

My coding challenge had to calculate the nearest transit stop given your current location. They asked for an efficient way to do this. The answer ended up being something I was not familiar with, Mongo DB and such database geo location built in functions.   Answer Question

the hiring process is kinda messy, but the people there including recruiters seem very nice, so they are making efforts to make things work. The team hire structure can be hit or miss, interviewers are less prepared, nothing ensures a consistent high bar. less of getting talents more of filling the positions. the offer making process really shows the philosophy of the company. people are hired for working on tasks, not to help building a great company. Very much a top down structure than eng driven like google. Seems that engs are just expected to follow orders, not to think or improve. the stock option is offered without mentioning the current fair market value, only throwing big potential growth, red flag 1, getting arrogant and cold when trying to negotiate, red flag 2. If future employees are not treated with respect, hard to imagine how things would be when actually working there.

I sent a direct email to a recruiter there saying I was looking for a new job and was interested in Uber. He almost instantly answered to my email offering to hop on the phone the following morning to chat about what I was looking for. We spend ~20min on the phone trying to figure out what my strengths were and what I was looking for, and we concluded that growth would be a good fit. I was quitting my job 2 weeks later, and am on a working visa, so I stressed them about being in a rush and to please make the process as fast as possible. Which they did. Sent me a coding challenge right after the phone call - Multiple choices of different APIs to use and do something about it; I did it in the shape of a backbone app with a ruby backend. Worked on this over the weekend (I found it really fun to do actually) and sent it over on monday. Tuesday I had a interview scheduled - they knew I was taking a plane Friday, so they happily scheduled the itw on Thursday. Spend about 4 hours there, split in 4 interviews of different types. Algorithms, problem solving, live code and front-end. All interviews were done by 2 interviewers, all from the growth team, all seems super excited about the team and the company. The interviews, despite being quite stressful, were actually a lot of fun. The fourth interview was a wrap up with the team's manager, who told me not to worry, everybody really liked me so they'll send an offer my way. I would negotiate offer details with the recruiter. We then chatted casually about his background, mine, some other random stuff and had a quick tour of the office and was introduce to random people we walked by. That was really cool and I felt really valued. I originally contacted Uber because I happened to have a hold of a recruiter's email, but was not especially into Uber. I was generally aiming a bigger startups (airbnb, sqaure and facebook were my other main choices), but this interview really just made me wanna work for the company. The next morning I chatted with the recruiter on the phone while waiting for my place. Again a nice casual chat were he asked me what kind of offer I was expecting and it all seemed really just to be about how to get somewhere that would make me happy. He clearly explain the stock options plan, etc. We got to an agreement and told me the offer would be taken care of and sent to me by email the following week. I instantly called all other pending offers and interviews and cancelled. The rest of the week was spent taking care of my visa and all went flawless. I've been at Uber for more than a year now, and I'm still convinced I made the best choice in my career!

I interviewed at Uber because they are an impressive company and probably a great place to work. I didn't receive and offer. I cannot say that I was surprised. I do believe there were a few things they could have done better to increase my chances as well as to treat their candidates better. As others have mentioned, they encourage their candidates to handle a coding challenge. While this is not unreasonable, they did not set clear expectations. Specifically, if you are invited on-site, they will carefully review your submission in person. I might have performed better at the interview if I didn't have to admit so many areas for improvement in my submission. Had I been aware that my code would be part of the interview, I probably would have done a better job. This is something to be aware of because they failed to mention it prior to my submission. Otherwise, the interviews were tough and tiring. The questions were somewhat less structured than many other companies. The office seemed quite disorganized. I doubt it's always like that, but it did appear that I was invited at an especially hectic time, both at the office and in the neighborhood outside. I might have benefited from them inviting me at a more reasonable time. The recruiter had rushed me through the whole process. Maybe I would have been more prepared if I hadn't allowed this to happen. Finally, they repeatedly volunteered to pay to reimburse my transportation costs and then failed to do so. It wasn't a significant amount, but it was more than I have spent anywhere else. The only reason I splurged was that, with no suggestion of my own, the recruiter volunteered to cover the costs multiple times. Of course, after I was rejected I was not reimbursed. It's an easy empty promise to make.

I apply on the career fair. Got two phone interview a week later. Not difficult algorithm problem. But I have difficult to hear on the phone. It seems it is very noisy at office. Then got an on-site invitation. Recruiter said the interview will be 3 hours but actually it is 2 hours with 3 people. It seems the interview is poorly organized. They ask me a lot of javascript question which i am familiar with.

Had an initial call with a recruiter who wanted to gauge my understanding of Uber's business model and interest in the company. Then had a phone call with the hiring manager before coming in for four onsite interviews. The interviewers all spent a good amount of time getting to know me before moving on to the technical portion, which was mostly coding on a whiteboard. Things were a bit hectic when I interviewed - Uber had outgrown the office and interviews were done in a quiet corner. Also, the list of interviewers changed quite a bit. Another notable thing was Uber was the only company that asked how I handle stress. All signs of rapid growth, but not necessarily a bad thing.

I applied on their website and had a call with a recruiter within a week. The next day he asked me to do a coding challenge. I spent the weekend doing it and within a day of sending it to them, they said I had impressed them with my work and asked me to fly to SF for a final round. Note that I had to book my own flight and hotel and I didn't get reimbursed until two weeks later. Not a big deal but be prepared to front about $1,000 if you're coming from the east coast on such short notice. The onsite wasn't very organized, people stepped in and out. I met with all engineers (besides a brief chat with the recruiter), in total about 8 - 10 people. I know for a fact I didn't do well on one interview. The interviewer had a very strong European accent and I also answered one of his questions wrong. He even laughed at me, which I thought was extremely rude. I did well on all the other interviews throughout the day. A week later I got a rejection email saying that they liked my passion but didn't think I had enough Python experience. Very much a canned rejection email.

I was contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn who was looking for a backend developer, I informed her that wasn't my speciality but if they were looking for <insert speciality here> I'd be happy to talk to them. She passed me off to another recruiter who set me up with a call with the hiring manager. Call with hiring manager mostly covered non-technical topics, largely about how my speciality might fit in at Uber. After that I had an onsite interview scheduled. The onsite was a technically rigorous interview with three sessions, it reminded me of the Google style interview process. Some whiteboard coding, lots of discussions about how my speciality could fit in at Uber and a lot of sysadmin style technology questions. Everyone I met was really pleasant and very smart. I got a call just under a week later saying that they I had done well but weren't convinced that I had demonstrated sufficient software engineering skills (outside my speciality) and asked if I could do a take home coding test. I finished the test in a handful of hours over two evenings and got it back to them. From the sounds of things the code test normally happens before the onsite interview. A few days after that I heard that they wanted to make an offer. At this point I was also waiting for an offer from another company and told them so and asked for some time. The recruiter was happy to give me time to consider other offers and went through the offer in some detail. The offer was a good (but not amazing) salary plus stock options, the stock options were worth almost as much as the salary at the present valuation of the company (according to the recruiter). The story takes an unexpected detour here as my other offer is delayed due to problems at the other company. The recruiter was very understanding but grew a little frustrated as the delay turned into a multiple week saga. Eventually the other company made an offer that had a similar salary component but a much larger equity component. It was a hard choice but I was more interested in the market segment of the other company so I declined Uber's offer. Everyone I met at Uber was great and I would have been delighted to work there.

Please find our standard web test below! Code Test! Bam! Uber clients are able to store favorite locations for easy pickup requests. Create a backend and a frontend for managing favorite locations. This is a simple exercise, but organize, design and test your code as if it were going into production. When you’re done, host it somewhere and provide us with a URL and a tarball or Git repo with the code. Backend Using the language (Python preferred), libraries and data store of your choosing, create a JSON in/out RESTful API for managing favorite locations. Stay away from Django or Rails, but microframeworks like Flask (preferred), Sinatra or Express are fine. Attributes of a favorite location object include: id, lat, lng, address (e.g. 800 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94114), name (e.g. Work) Frontend Using JavaScript, Backbone.js and any other libraries of your choosing, create an interface to access the API. User should be able to: Create a new location Read/view a location, and a collection of all locations Update an existing location Delete a location The UX is up to you, with a couple of constraints: Incorporate a map Geocode the address so the user is not required to enter lat/lng Extras If you like, get creative and do whatever else you like on the backend and/or frontend to show off.   1 Answer

I was referred to Uber by an acquaintance. After a standard phone screen, I was asked to complete a coding exercise that would take 6–8 hours. While I approve of coding exercises as an interviewing technique, a working day is a rather large time commitment so early in an interviewing process. I politely responded that I would like to see how my other interviews (which were much further along) conclude before completing the exercise. I received a rather rude and terse response from the in-house recruiter: "Doesn't sound like we are the right fit for what you are looking for." I'm happy that I did not interview further.

The take-home challenge was good - emphasis here is on owning a full stack for a service, and this was the first time I had written an API using Flask.   Answer Question

When I was hired the company was small so this is less relevant, but I did a take-home challenge and then one day of in-person interviews, followed by a quick half-day cultural fit interview (at that point I'm pretty sure they were going to make an offer).

Talked to a number of engineers and had an opportunity to ask a number of questions. The interviewers were courteous and answered my questions candidly. I wasn't asked any silly brainteaser questions, and the interviews all seemed focused on my ability to help them. After the interview I had a chance to meet more of the team and see the office.

Phone call interview, the interviewer doesn't' sound like he's interviewed much, and it was very awkward through out the interview, he didn't talk much and I wasn't sure what to make out of it. The test was pretty standard that I have to code through an online editor however he seemed to let me use whatever resources i can get which was pretty rare. But one negative effect was that the editor can compile and I kept on getting segfault which i couldn't debug in time.

Applied online, had a phone interview with a software engineer. I was then asked to come down to San Francisco for an onsite interview, but then they responded the day after saying that they were confident that all they needed was a last phone interview. Had the phone interview with a Head of Engineering. This was probably the most enjoyable interview I've ever had, no specific technical coding questions, but we talked about general coding at length.
