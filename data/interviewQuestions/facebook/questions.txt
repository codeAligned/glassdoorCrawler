I can't discuss specifics due to NDA, but interview questions were neither overly difficult nor tricky. Check careercup and brush up on algorithms (string processing, binary trees, graphs, etc.). Practice coding fast (which potentially means forgetting good software engineering practices such as class design, refactoring as it will only slow you down). Establish rapport with your interviewer, remember to ask clarifying questions, talk through your thinking process and solutions and you'll do well. Hopefully better than me:) Best of luck!   Answer Question

You have a string that consists of all types of characters, alphanumeric, special, uppercase and lowercase. The string should still tell me that it is a palindrome or not. For example: 12@#.Race@#car. The example is a palindrome. (Omit the special characters, and do not consider the string to be case sensitive). I wrote the code in O(n), but I was using an extra string to store only the letters. The interviewer asked me to do it in place (use only that string and check for palindrome)   Answer Question

Before I get to the question I just want to say that the interviewer had a very thick accent (I'm an international candidate, BTW), and that made it really difficult for me to understand what he wanted me to do. This isn't me being bitter. I'm saying this so that I present a very honest opinion about my interview. That being said, the question wasn't something that can be found online or in most books, I was given 2 functions String recv() and String ReadLine() [ both these DO NOT take arguments]. recv() generates some string (Example:"123\n45\n6789"). ReadLine() should read the string being returned by recv() and print all characters until the first \n. After that it should read the recv() string again and print the next characters until the 2nd \n. Example: recv(): "123\n45\n6789" ReadLine(): "123" //first call of ReadLine ReadLine(): "45" // second call of ReadLine However, the next sequence now doesn't have a \n. So, once the end of the string is hit, the ReadLine() function must call recv() again, and append all characters until it reads a \n. Continuing the above example: ReadLine():6789abcde //Third call of ReadLine recv():"abc"// still no \n...so you must call recv() again recv():"de\n" The commented sections are my explanations (the interviewer didn't give any such things). I've explained the problem as clearly as I can. Unfortunately, the interviewer kept overwriting his examples, and (I have to emphasize this) his accent made it really hard to understand just what he wanted out of this program.   1 Answer

I forgot some of the coding problems, but here are what I can remember. 1. move all 0s to the front of an integer array. 2. given a target and a sorted array, find the highest value smaller than the target. 3. given a 0-1 matrix, find the largest graph that is 1-connected. 4. design a system that can quickly return public accounts' activity data. For example, how many persons like/comment Taylor Swift's status. 5. In culture fit round, was asked many questions about how and why did you make this decision, what would you do in this case. For example, why did you apply for grad school? why not go to industry after undergrad? Why did you choose your current company three years ago? Why did you move to this state?

The initial question (writing a function to calculate a square root) ended up being the most difficult because it threw me off. I knew there was a good iterative method for doing so, but could not recall Newton's method in the moment, and I sadly let this nagging thought get in the way of my ability to work through the problem. My failure to perform well on that question set a negative tone for the rest of the interview, since each interviewer after the first can see notes from the previous interviewers.   9 Answers

You are given an integer N and an integer M. You are supposed to write a method void findBestCoinsThatMinimizeAverage(int N, int M) that prints the best collection of N coins that minimize the average number of minimum coins needed to generate values from 1 to M. So, if M = 100, and N = 4, then if we use the set {1, 5, 10, 25} to generate each value from 1 to 100, so that for each value the number of coins are minimized, i.e. 1 = 1 (1 coin), 2 = 1 + 1 (2 coins),..., 6 = 1 + 5 (2 coins), ..., 24 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (8 coins), and we take the average of these coins, we would see that the average comes out to ~5.7. But if we instead use {1, 5, 18, 25}, the average would come out to be 3.7. We are to find that set of N coins, and print them, that produce the minimum average.   8 Answers
