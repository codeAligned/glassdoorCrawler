2015-10-06 08:32:35.547,i applied to facebook through their website and got a call from the recruiter the next day. he asked the standard screening questions and set up a technical phone screen for later that week. the phone screen was done using coderpad.io  and they threw me off from the very beginning by setting up a c   environment although i had told the recruiter that i was most comfortable in python and although i never claimed anywhere that i had any familiarity with c  . still  interview questions tend to be general enough that  as long as you aren t completely unfamiliar with the language syntax  you can generally do a decent job in any language. so off we went in c  . the interviewer was very pleasant  and even gave me some tips for how to improve my resume at the beginning. then we dived into the coding. he had actually chosen a great question to determine my programming ability. unfortunately  i botched it by making too many assumptions about the question and not considering carefully enough what lay behind the interface that the interviewer had provided me. this all happened maybe two or three weeks ago and i am sure that i won t be progressing to the next step. the one negative in all this is that the recruiter has not followed up at all with me. yes  rejection is not uncommon when applying at a company like facebook  but that doesn t mean that the company shouldn t have the courtesy to at least inform you of it. so overall  great experience in the beginning but i was turned off by the lack of respect for the process that i sensed from the recruiter.,given a buffer like interface from which you can only read data in chunks of a fixed size  implement a reader which can read as many bytes as it wants from this interface.   answer question

2015-07-23 21:55:24.97,i was contacted by a recruiter and had a phone chat with her the next day. after a week  i went to to the in house interview. i arrived 5 minutes before the scheduled time and i waited for 20 minutes in the reception area. my scheduled interviewer could not make it and they found a young engineer to interview me instead. he is friendly and has worked in the industry for only 2 years. the conversation started almost like i was the interviewer as he introduced himself and told me what he does at facebook for about 5 minutes. he asked me what i do in my current project and proceeded with a coding question. i solved the question in java  tested edge cases  modularized the solution and discussed other potential solutions i could think of. we had a nice conversation and the interviewer agreed the solution given was good. he ended the interview by giving me the opportunity to ask any questions. they did not proceed to the next stage with me and i was surprised. obviously i missed something and i do not know what that is. i asked the recruiter for feedback via e mail and did not hear back.,my current project and how i scale our applications. given n nodes and an x node  find k nearest nodes to x.   answer question
2015-09-14 17:49:53.627,asked a friend to refer me. was contacted by a recruiter within two days. quickly scheduled a tech screen  essentially mini ninja interview . after that came the on site loop. 2 ninja  2 pirate and 1 jedi interviews. can t share specific questions  but plenty of other people did already. unlike google  interviewed with them also   facebook seems to have a smaller question pool as one of the system design questions i got i ve also seen on glassdoor before. i recommend going through the information recruiters provide for interview preparation. since google and facebook use very similar processes   stevey s blog rants  get that job at google  post is also quite relevant and useful. know your data structures  algorithms  practice solving problems for a few weeks and you should be in good shape. for system design questions  you will be asked to design facebook scale systems. think data way beyond the scope of one machine  billions of items  thousands of requests per second. hands on experience with such systems is of course  the king . in the absence of that   study distributed nosql systems  mapreduce and similar things and you should be in good shape. overall i was very happy with the on site interviews and the level of support facebook recruiters and engineers provided me. this was probably the best interview experience that i ve had. having a competing offer handy will surely help you negotiate better compensation. facebook seems to have an awesome culture. deciding to reject their very generous offer for another one wasn t an easy call. one really can t go wrong by joining facebook. facebook is the only company that i know that provides interview feedback. regardless whether you pass or not i recommend asking for it as it will help you get better.,data structures  sorting  big o notation  large system design.   answer question

2015-07-08 20:35:22.757,i ve applied through an employee referral and got a ping from the recruiter in about a week. after the initial chat with the recruiter to chat about fb  my interests and logistics  i got scheduled for the initial 45 minute screening. i was given two options for the screen  either phone codeshare or an onsite visit  likely an option available for local candidates only . i chose the in person option  and got an invite for a round of full day  5 total  within few hours after the initial screen. facebook recruiters send interview prep materials to the candidates on what to expect  what to brush up on  as well as some suggestions tailored to a particular candidate s weak ish spots  in my case it was the speed of coding . i knew what to expect going in and felt well prepared on this front. initial screen was algorithm   coding. nothing overly challenging. onsite consisted of 5 interviews    informal lunch  covering  1  one  jedi  interview with a hiring manager testing behavior   culture fit   warm up coding. prepare to talk about past experience  career goals  as well as several  tell me about the time when...  questions. 2  one  pirate  interview  system design portion of the interview. there are great resources on quora on suggestions on how to prepare and what to pay attention too. 3  three  ninja  interviews focusing on algorithm   coding. i actually have seen all of the questions i got asked at facebook before  but that did not help me as ultimately the reason for rejection was cited as not being able to come up with optimal solutions and code fast enough. got an phone call from the recruiter in about a week few days after the interview telling me the unfortunate news. i think i had to wait few extra days because of the july holidays and typically the process is faster. culture  i did find some of the junior facebook engineers conducting my interview a bit arrogant and cocky  but nothing too alarming. all in all  i had a positive interview experience. i wish the interview loop was better tailored towards someone more senior  e.g. less emphasis on coding  more on design. current interview process makes it seem they hire code monkeys.,i can t discuss specifics due to nda  but interview questions were neither overly difficult nor tricky. check careercup and brush up on algorithms  string processing  binary trees  graphs  etc. . practice coding fast  which potentially means forgetting good software engineering practices such as class design  refactoring as it will only slow you down . establish rapport with your interviewer  remember to ask clarifying questions  talk through your thinking process and solutions and you ll do well. hopefully better than me   best of luck    answer question

2015-09-16 09:17:36.873,if you re a solid developer with years of experience working on high visibility products used by millions of people  and references to back it up  don t expect the interview process at facebook to just work. it really comes down to how much you prepare yourself mentally to code within the context of an interview  and how much you study career cups as well as the other resources given to you by the recruiter. sadly  you don t have to be a great developer at all. what s interesting is that none of these skills have been necessary during my 17 years of real world experience. i never had to write code on a whiteboard  except for other interviews  and i don t see how  writing code fast  should be considered a measurement of someone s productivity and code quality. that sort of thinking seems naive and haphazard to me. what frightens me is that i think facebook truly believes they re  raising the bar  with this system. but they re not always hiring good people  and they re probably turning down a lot of great folks. the coding tests were super easy. two were questions i ve actually asked myself while conducting interviews for another company which was aimed towards entry level developers. i really wish they would have asked more challenging questions. i was able to finish them before the end of each panel  and with optimal solution. the design question they gave me actually aligned with something i developed and designed for a product used by millions. i felt good with how everything went at the end of the day  but somehow i failed at  both  coding and design. interesting... whatever. two of my friends  whom of which i mentored at my last company  were able to get offers at facebook  same office  same interview process  but they were  not  the best coders nor the top performers  so if you get turned down at facebook  don t take it seriously. they say there is some  randomness  in the interview  but it just seems strange that common sense didn t kick anywhere to question the obvious  or just the fact i was interviewed by a few people with only 5 years experience. smart  but inexperienced  and somewhat arrogant  wanting to judge you with entry level coding questions. half of the people that interviewed me didn t go through the interview process themselves. they were brought in by acquisitions. specifically for a product that isn t doing very well right now. i was excited about the idea of working there initially  but after the interview  i wasn t so sure anyway. they do try to put a lot of emphasis on finding great developers  but many of the folks who interviewed me mentioned the codebase was a mess  probably from writing code so quickly and not thinking through it  and their open office  no cubes  no walls  just wires and computers everywhere  is a bit distracting. not something genuinely appreciated by the people working there who used to have their own office. when you need to focus and get quality work done  there are only so many dedicated rooms to use and they re usually taken. coupled with the fact that they re seattle office is located in one of the worst traffic areas  i wasn t so sure i would have accepted anyway.,signed an nda but just check the resources given to you by the recruiter   answer question

2015-07-08 17:14:54.173,i started off with a standard technical phone screen with a facebook engineer. it was a simple coding exercise with two questions of surprisingly low difficulty. i cleared this easily. facebook s on site interview process is far more rigorous  though. each 45 min interview has a clearly defined role  intended to test you from multiple different angles. specifically  i went through    2  ninja  interviews  coding   algorithms    2  pirate  interviews  system design    1  jedi  interview  behavioral   simple coding  plus lunch with a facebook engineer. the  ninja  and  jedi  interviews were straightforward. i hadn t seen the coding questions before  but they were not particularly hard. i would rate them as being of just average difficulty  pretty similar to the whiteboard coding questions asked at most other major silicon valley tech companies. and the behavioral section of the  jedi  interview was just a friendly chat about my resume and my past experiences. however  the  pirate  interviews were what killed me. both  pirate  interviews involved being asked to propose and discuss a design for existing features on facebook. the interviewers were extremely meticulous and questioned me on virtually every last detail of my design decisions. in particular  they focused a lot on how huge datasets should be stored and accessed to support extremely large scale distributed systems. even though i am already working on web scale systems in my current job  i was nonetheless still way under prepared for this level of technical challenge and scrutiny. my advice to all prospective candidates is to spend most of your time preparing for the  pirate  interviews. the coding questions aren t hard  but the system design questions will likely stretch you to your limit   unless you re a fresh grad  they don t ask  pirate  questions to fresh grads. lucky folks   additional side note  interestingly  my facebook recruiter actually gave me detailed post mortem feedback on each and every one of my interviews. they are the only major silicon valley company i know that does this  so major kudos to them for being so considerate.,can t disclose due to nda. but as mentioned above  the coding questions are really straightforward and of merely average difficulty. it s the system design   pirate   questions that can be really  really challenging. definitely spend a good portion of your time preparing for the latter    answer question

2015-04-08 21:02:12.25,recruiter reached out to me on linkedin. had a chat on the phone and decided to mutually move ahead. the first round was a basic phone round with a software engineer   nothing too difficult  . cleared it and came onsite. as known  the pattern onsite is one behavioral interview with a coding question followed by 2 coding interviews and 1 design interview. will not disclose the onsite questions due to nda. the behavioral interview person was yawning throughout the 40 minutes and the coding interview question asked at the end of the behavioral interview was one of those questions which you either know  don t know. i was expected to know the solution and code it in 10 minutes which pretty much negated the problem solving aspect of it. the 2 coding round questions were pretty standard. however  one of the questions was a text book question and i stated that i knew the solution to that question following which the question asked was way too tough to be solved in 25 minutes on the white board. similarly the design interview involved a lot of math and was more difficult than coming up with an architecture . this had been informed prior to the interview though. overall   the interview experience was mixed probably because most of the questions seemed to be the type of questions that one would  wouldn t know. there was very little problem solving aspect to the whole process and sadly that is pretty much the case with some interviews for tech companies,phone round question given 2 strings  write a function to check if the two words are one edit away from each other. i.e one word can be formed from another by inserting  deleting   replacing one character valid examples   car   cas car  card invalid examples   car  caert   5 answers

2015-04-09 11:31:38.913,was contacted by facebook recruiter. i thought i will give it a try. i selected in person tech screen vs phone interview since i think it is much easier to express yourself in person  plus there is whiteboard. especially  if it is a graph or tree problem  easier to draw on whiteboard. i had to sign nda unfortunately  so won t be able to share the exact question. but for a software engineer  not senior   the question was pretty hard to solve in 40 minutes. backtracking was required and the best solution to the problem is n   n factorial . so if you haven t heard of the problem before  it is quite likely you will spend time just on finding an optimal solution before jumping to code. that s what i did. however  i was able to code most of the solution and interviewer seemed happy. he himself told me that. interviewer was pretty nice. he answered my questions pretty well and seemed down to earth  only thing i am not sure is the choice of question. i was informed that they will not move ahead with the on site round  which is what i expected.,nda signed. but the question involved matrix calculations and required backtracking. best solution was n    answer question

2015-04-14 11:48:23.367,i was first contacted by a recruiter through linkedin. we had a quick chat on the phone before he scheduled a phone screen with an engineer. i don t remember the question from the phone screen  but it was a standard coding screening type interview of about 30 minutes. there was a little bit of time for other questions  but the focus was entirely on coding ability. a few days later  the recruiter contacted me again and arranged for an on site interview in seattle. i had four approximately hour long interviews with a shorter lunch interview part of the way through. although the interviews were themed  e.g.   pirate    ninja   etc.   all were very focused on coding except for one which focused on architecting a system. several of the coding questions required figuring out the trick underlying the problem in order to get a good solution quickly. many other companies have stopped asking these kinds of questions since they ve found they are not very good at identifying the best people to hire. i felt like i reached satisfactory solutions for each of the questions  but based on feedback i received from the recruiter afterward it was clear they would have preferred me to have been faster. everybody i interviewed with was friendly and fairly organized  but the sole emphasis on coding and problem solving questions turned me off to the interview process. while it s important to suss out a candidate s technical abilities  these questions don t do a very good job of that. moreover  they completely ignore other qualities a senior engineer needs to succeed such as cultural fit  leadership abilities  ability to motivate influence others  having vision  etc. overall it felt like the process was overly tailored towards entry level college hires instead of mid career professionals with existing experience. i did not get an offer  but would not have accepted anyways.,you  039 re given an array of numbers  and you want to find 3 numbers that sum to 0 and output those 3 numbers. you can use each number multiple times. so if you  039 re given the array   1  1  2   you would output   1   1  2  because  1  1  2 0   4 answers

2015-01-14 10:49:13.11,i was contacted by a recruiter  i came onsite for an initial screen. i thought the interviewer was very nice  and the question was reasonable. however  the frustrating part for me was that for the given question  there were a few different ways to solve it. from my perspective  it seemed that the approach i used to solve the question was not what the interviewer had in mind. i understand that you should listen to an interviewer when they interrupt you or give you hints  but to me it seemed like the  hints  were basically from the perspective of  you re not solving this the way i would solve it  even though both of our solutions are o n  . the result was that i was basically having to write out a problem on a white board and constantly have my train of thought interrupted. the interruptions were unnecessary  and i had to clarify to the interviewer that my intent would indeed work. example interruption  interviewer   that array index is giving you the same result as the other value  me   no  that s a different variable name  interviewer   oh  oops. continue  or interviewer   wait  why are you replacing the for loop with a while loop   me   because i want to be able to manipulate the cursor directly  interviewer   oh  ok. continue  in the above statement  it s clear that the usual method of solving the problem did not involve a while loop  but it could be done to solve the problem . after my solution  the interviewer explained the most straightforward solution to the problem which basically leveraged the constraints of the problem itself  and after seeing that then of course the problem was trivial to implement. so to me  it seemed like the question was more of a riddle than a coding exercise  which i believe to be a bad interview question  and at my current company it s accepted as the worst type of interview question. it was rather embarrassing for me to be turned down  especially on just the initial screen  but another qualm i had was that screens are generally meant to filter out candidates that can t code at all  not candidates who are questionable in their skills  from my perspective my skills aren t questionable  but clearly i did not give my best performance in this screen . to me it felt as though the interviewer in this case did not have much experience. while i was answering the questions that were given to me  i was having to explain a few quirks to the python language that the interviewer clearly did not know i.e.  oh  i didn t know you could compare dictionaries like that . for that to be said  i can only infer that the only thing this interviewer was looking for is if i answer the question that was given to me in the exact way they wanted it solved.,basically an array manipulation problem   answer question

2015-02-13 12:48:28.53,i applied through a referral  1 skype interview  2 were scheduled but i didn t make it past the first one . the interviewer briefly introduced himself and asked me a coding question straight away. i chose to use java. no behavioral questions  just 1 coding question. contrary to what most people have said  i got an interviewer who wasn t very friendly. he was there to do his job. plain and simple.,before i get to the question i just want to say that the interviewer had a very thick accent  i m an international candidate  btw   and that made it really difficult for me to understand what he wanted me to do. this isn t me being bitter. i m saying this so that i present a very honest opinion about my interview. that being said  the question wasn t something that can be found online or in most books  i was given 2 functions string recv   and string readline     both these do not take arguments . recv   generates some string  example  123 n45 n6789  . readline   should read the string being returned by recv   and print all characters until the first  n. after that it should read the recv   string again and print the next characters until the 2nd  n. example  recv     123 n45 n6789  readline     123    first call of readline readline     45     second call of readline however  the next sequence now doesn t have a  n. so  once the end of the string is hit  the readline   function must call recv   again  and append all characters until it reads a  n. continuing the above example  readline   6789abcde   third call of readline recv    abc    still no  n...so you must call recv   again recv    de n  the commented sections are my explanations  the interviewer didn t give any such things . i ve explained the problem as clearly as i can. unfortunately  the interviewer kept overwriting his examples  and  i have to emphasize this  his accent made it really hard to understand just what he wanted out of this program.   1 answer

2015-03-18 22:17:53.907,i applied online to the facebook website in january. facebook was really  absurdly fast for me. for the online application  they responded in about a week  and i scheduled the interview in the next week. after two phone interviews  they emailed me back in the same day. the interviewers were programmers  and they made me feel very comfortable. with other companies  i sometimes would get interviewers who knew nothing about programming  and it made it hard for me to talk about my projects without accidentally going into too much depth or jargon that they likely wouldn t understand. it was really comfortable talking with the facebook interviewers  and it was easy to ask questions at the end because i knew they d know about stuff like the oculus or what programming life was like there. like many others have said  i would highly recommend cracking the coding interview. the questions were relatively easy  and two of them were ones i already saw on this site. my interviewers really liked that i spoke all of my thoughts out loud while i was programming.,you have two words and would like to find the  minimum edit distance  between them. edit distance is defined as the number of operations with  adding a letter  subtracting a letter  and replacing a letter. make a function that finds the minimum edit distance.   1 answer

2014-11-30 15:01:06.777,facebook came to my campus career fair where i turned in my resume. i had an onsite interview in new york which went well. it was completely a technical interview with only programming. i was asked 2 questions   the first was a simple reverse a signed integer  the second was a harder pattern matching problem that could be solved using a prefix tree. i was invited to a second on site interview in menlo park. it was a long flight across the country and in hindsight totally not worth the time wasted   i skipped classes and turned in homework late as a result. the on site was awful. my interviewer showed up late and then proceeded to ask me a very simple question about printing the paths to nodes in a binary tree. coded it up with some minor corrections  since i was white boarding and you miss some stuff when you re face is glued to a wall . he then extended the question but cut me off because we ran out of time  this was completely his fault since he showed up a good 15 minutes late . they proceeded to give me a tour of the campus and talk with current engineers. it would have been fun if it hadn t been for the bad interview. overall  i got the feeling that they re a large company and are definitely not as agile as they were a couple of years ago. engineers were very complacent and talked more about their great perks than personal growth. in the end  i think i got caught in the interview anti loop and had some poor luck. promptly rejected. i really wish i hadn t wasted 48 hours flying for that sad excuse of an interview.,the pattern matching question in my 1st interview was reasonably tricky  but the interview did a fantastic job of giving me the right clues to help me solve it on my own.   answer question

2013-12-06 05:13:50.077,this was for a position in their infrastructure team in cambridge ma. recruiter contacted me in september and was very interested in my background and experience with highly scalable systems   both in finance and mobile phone payments. i attended some small intimate presentations they did as they were initially opening a new boston office and wanted to grow it out. the meetings were great and i learned a lot about how they solve some of their biggest problems. i then did a screening interview on site  because i don t do technical screens well on the phone . the question was  given a binary tree  write code to print the tree out line by line . i did ok and got the breadth first search down fine  but couldn t figure out the   line by line part.  turns out this is facebook s  1 question to ask in interviews . although my performance wasn t great they gave me a break on that and asked me back for another screening interview. this time i prepared well for another coding interview but it turned out to be a design interview. the problem was  imagine you have 10 000 servers and need to monitor the performance of each one  how would you do it    naturally you need to be able to not take too much of the bandwidth and so you ll have to do sampling  have some history to watch for trends etc. i passed that and was very excited to be flown out to menlo park for the final round. i studied like crazy based on questions on this site and careercup. i took 4 weeks and studied about 15 hours per week. turns out i focused on the wrong questions   i studied tree  string  array and list algorithms based on the distribution of q a but i was asked binary math and heap algorithms. here are the questions i was asked. 1  how would you implement division without      or multiplication  a  classic  question  but not one of the ones i would focus on . i bombed on this as i was not expecting and could not recall my binary math. i figured out the high level outline but that was all. that i was asked this in the  culture fit  interview made this doubly unexpected. 2  given 10 000 servers containing a billion integers each how would you find how to find the median  i knew the answer to this question  use two heaps    not because i had focused on it  but i had found it an interesting question while studying. however he then asked  how much memory do you need   and i didn t know how big the heaps would need to be. the real answer i was trying to get is   what is the minimum heap you need. i had a guess but i think i got this wrong. 3  given a list structure where each node contains a next node and optionally a pointer to another list  flatten that list e.g. l1     l2     l3     l7     l8   v l4     l5   l6 will be flattened to l1     l2     l3    l4    l5   l6   l7   l8 i did ok on this   getting the answer   but it appeared i took too long. the interviewer also interrupted me a lot while i was writing an initial solution and that threw me off   i like to be more iterative in my problem solving but i think he expected 100  immediate correctness. he had an observer there too and that guy looked bored out of his mind and that bugged me a little too as it wasn t clear who would be doing the judging. 4  i was also handed some hard to read python code  i don t know python  and asked to figure out what it does. i did ok on this   but again surprised to be handed hard to read code in a language i didn t know. 5  one final question  how would you implement the  ls  unix function in your language of choice. it should take the input   ls a b c   e   f     g and the output should be similar the the output given by unix.  i used a tree structure to represent the file directory structure and wrote a solution from there. i did ok on this. overall  everyone seemed very nice   i had a nice lunch and the campus is interesting but it was clear that what i studied was not what i needed to  so lesson learned  don t just trust the distribution of questions on glassdoor or careercup . i even got to walk past zuckerberg s office  more of a conference room  and saw sheryl sandberg in there. one interesting thing i learned is a lot of google people are leaving for facebook. also i d say if you are over 30  i am 41  you are a rare bird at facebook     i knew based on the reactions of the interviewers that it was very probably a bust  but overall a good experience and something i will learn from. very disappointing as i really wanted to be one of the first few facebook engineers in the boston area   and to work on their super high scalability issues but such is life.,how would you implement division without      or multiplication   9 answers

2015-03-01 10:25:22.84,the interview process for me was uberly long. i wasn t planning on applying to facebook  but a recruiter reached out to me mid december on linkedin. i thought  what the heck  it s a great company  and got back to her the next day  but she was leaving for the xmas break. no more communication until early jan. connecting on the phone was a pain  as first she didn t call until 15 minutes after she said she would. i had stopped standing by the phone and went to email her when she did call  so missed it. we emailed and set something up for an hour later. this time she called 30 minutes late. no apologies or anything. sigh. she advised that i put all of my other interviews before the facebook one so that i could get practice  and then signed me up for a free interview review course they run. i went and things were all great  so i told them i was ready. queue another 2 week pause while they tried to answer a question i had asked before scheduling me. when i finally made it onsite for an interview  mid late feb   i had expected it to be a full day of interviewing  but instead it was a 30 minute screen before i could do the  actual  interview. in all fairness  i should have seen that coming. but anyways  did the screen and got a response before i had even left the parking that they wanted to schedule my full interview. i also got a call from my recruiter that afternoon to give me interview feedback. i thought that was awesome  as most people don t do that. i can t say how useful it was as i had no negative feedback from my interviewers and her advice was just  wow  keep doing whatever you just did   but it sounds like it could be useful if things don t go perfectly the first time around. anywho  by this time i had multiple other offers with deadlines on them. i went ahead and scheduled the final round interview for the following week  but ended up canceling the day before as i had decided to go with another company. this seemed to irk my recruiter  despite the fact that she was the one who told me to interview with other companies first and i had been upfront about that and the associated timelines during the whole process. when initial contact and end offer are 2.5 months apart  you can t expect someone to be sitting idle that whole time... the only reason i still rank this as a positive experience is because i had a secondary recruiter i worked with coordinating onsite logistics  the girl who first contacted me was out of state  and he was awesome. if any of you get the chance  work with charlie. he s direct and super straight forward and knows that candidates are people with multiple options and treats you as such. i do a lot of mentoring and will certainly be sending any of my mentees who expresses interest in fbook charlie s way  he s a real gem.,one of the questions i got was around bit manipulation and built on itself by layers  i.e. how would you do x  ok  say you have a function for x  how would you do this new thing y  . the other question was a modification of a sorting question  i.e. the question itself was sort the array  but there were some parameters on the data type that made things extra fun not standard sorting algorithm    answer question

2013-10-29 15:19:43.24,i was contacted by a recruiter for the security team through email about a few openings on the security team. i said  i would like to know more. after a number of email exchanges to set up a time  another recruiter emailed me and told me someone would call me at the scheduled time. the first recruiter mentioned that i will be using the tool on collabedit.com. so far  i was not told what position i was actually interviewing for or whether i was setting up a time for a general interview or whether they were giving me more details  i did apply to a few different roles on their site so i wasn t sure what was up. turns out first phone call was with hiring manager and i was getting interviewed for a software engineer position. hiring manager asked if i was told what positions were available and i said no and he was glad to explain for me. i told the manager i was hoping for a security engineering job  not software engineering. he told me i might be a better fit for a different team and he will tell the other manager i was interested and i will hear from him. i asked if there was a opening on that team and he said they are always hiring new talent. i took that as a good sign. i didn t actually get asked to code during the phone interview. i followed up with the recruiters asking where to proceed and whether i could interview with the manager on the other team and they said they will get back to me. i waited and got no emails setting up another interview. i asked what s going on and have not heard back. it s been 10 days. i guess i have been dropped  i am disappointed at the lack of communication and lack of detail from the recruiters. i guess this is common with big companies.,i had never heard of any questions that i was asked  in all the 4 rounds of interviews . so pretty much all the problem required me to think on the fly.   1 answer

2014-10-20 18:25:58.353,recruiter contacted on linkedin. set up phone screen for a few days later  which consisted of basic behavioral questions and some technical questions  basically questions passed to the recruiters by engineering to weed out super weak candidates . then a technical phone screen with an engineer. first a basic coding question. second question was a weird one. it was basically a language specific question related to how to modify the default behavior of a certain class. i spent the rest and a long portion of the interview trying to understand what exactly needed to be done and couldn t come up with a solution at all. then i asked the interviewer how what he was asking could be achieved and he told me about a similar class that would provide that capability. since i had no idea about that class  and there s really no reason for anyone to know it off top of their heads   i wasted a lot of time trying to solve something that i could have never solved. this was akin to a trick question and obviously very flawed to ask to a software engineer to assess any analytical skills whatsoever. then chit chatted with the engineer about facebook but it was obvious that neither side wanted to engage in anymore conversation. got a rejection email from the recruiter i believe a couple days later.,a seemingly analytical coding question which couldn t be solved at all if you didn t know a certain class.   answer question

2013-08-24 22:05:49.587,application was via an internal referral from a friend who used to work at a start up i was at. he put me in their system and around 4 days later  a recruiter called for first contact. the recruiter was quick to assess what i have done and decide to bring me straight in for a 1h30 min interview the next week. in this session i got a quick  hi  from the recruiter and then two 30 min slots  one on architecture and design  so called pirate interview  and the other on coding  ninja . of the 2  i stormed the coding question but met with an interviewer in the pirate side that had tailored a question from his previous experience in the area i had recently worked in and it didn t work out  mostly as i knew more about the topic and the interviewer wanted to talk about a specific trick he knew . still  i got called back the next week for a full day. lunch  more coding  culture interviews etc... coding and design were knockouts again  the softer skills were less successful. i think the key here is that you need to present a confident  well rehearsed personality with answers for the usual questions  biggest mistake etc... . do not talk about mistakes and then admit you don t know the root cause for them  even if they were true mysteries. pick another example    the process took  4 weeks  the end dragging out by 2 weeks as it seems they could not decide if it was a hire or not. i had multiple offers by this time and had to take one that was expiring and too good to miss. later i found that there was no hire decision and felt ok about it   i would probably think about going back at some point  but with a stronger prep in the softer skill q a side.,if you go through the career cup questions  all 3 of my questions were on there. one of them i only had 15 mins to answer  the most difficult one  due to over running.   answer question
2013-05-30 15:32:56.55,got referred through a friend at fb. they contacted me 1 2 weeks later via email. set up a phone chat that the recruiter initially missed  but we rescheduled. once we had a phone conversation she said they can move really fast   1 week to make an offer. i went on site for a first round interview  since i m local to the area . the interviewer was nice. she asked me to describe what i work on now. then we jumped into two coding problems. i interpreted the problem as a hamming distance problem and asked if it was  she kind of shrugged it off    i don t think she knew what hamming distance meant. i coded a solution on a laptop  new trial process they were doing   but it turned out we were not talking about the same problem. in retrospect  the problem she was describing was levenshtein distance. i had the feeling she only knew the solution to the problem because she had the answer sheet. the second problem was another classic dp problem. finding the sum of 1 s in a submatrix. i went on to describe the recurring relation for the subproblem in the linear case. she didn t want me to do that and she quickly said the solution to the 2d case was a generalization of the 1d case. because of the novelty of the laptop in the interview and the misunderstanding of the initial problem  the recruiter fought for me to do another phone screen even though the first one didn t go that well. the second interview i opted for a phone interview. this time the interviewer seemed more knowledgable and came into fb through an acquisition. i was asked what i work on now and some hard problem i solved in the past. again two interview questions were asked  using collabedit . the first was to list out all the paths in a binary tree which was simple. i did make some mistakes and corrected it in the code as we talked through use cases. the second problem was checking if a string was a palindrome for strings with symbols and spaces in them which again is easy. i did solve both problems  but in the beginning the interviewer stated he s looking for accuracy and performance. my tree traversal was a simple preorder traversal using recursion and the palindrome involved one loop. apparently the second interview did not go well even though i provided correct solutions in both. i guess the interviewer was serious when he said he s looking for correctness    i guess you need to be able to code compilable error free code in a text editor. the recruiter and onsite coordinator were very helpful and the interviewers were very friendly. however  the style of fb interviews seems to be that you should study and know by heart common interview puzzles algorithms dp problems and be able to reproduce that error free.,levenshtein distance  sum of 1 s in a submatrix  print all paths of a binary tree  palindrome   answer question

2013-04-15 15:10:04.493,an internal recruiter contacted me out of the blue by linkedin and email. we scheduled a phone call. talked about my experience and education and then about available positions at facebook. he then invited me to come onsite for a short screening interview first. i requested a couple of weeks to prepare for the interview. he was perfectly ok with that and even sent me some links to preparation materials. instead of a phone screen  i had a short 1 1 interview for 45 minutes onsite. mostly coding on whiteboard and a little time set aside for questions about the company. a week after that  four 1 1 interviews. two coding interviews. one  manager  interview  mostly talking about past projects and future ambitions. one system design interview   you basically have to describe how you would design a given system without going into too much detail. received a call from recruiter next day. he said that i will have to come for one more interview. so a week after i had another series of two interviews  one coding and one manager. i received an offer two days after the last interview. during the whole process  the company was very flexible about scheduling interviews. everything happens really fast if you want it  or you can take your time to prepare. recruiter was very nice and supportive  as were people at fb in general. some interviewers did not talk much and some were more willing to discuss  but all were very polite. coding questions involve basic data structures like trees  combinatorial problems and sometimes a relatively simple dynamic programming problem. they are not too hard but you have to do them quickly and explain everything clearly. understanding of big o is a must ,what are the most challenging issues in your work    answer question

2011-04-25 21:57:01.637,the phone interview was brief and mechanical. the interviewer seemed clearly unprepared  inexperienced  and uninterested  as if it was an unwanted interruption to their day. the interviewer had no knowledge of my previous conversations with the company or why exactly he was interviewing me. i was clearly passed his way expressly for the purpose of evaluating my technical ability. the interviewer asked two coding questions  using an online collaborative editor to view my progress. after the problem was sufficiently answered  the interviewer quickly ended the conversation. as it has been described to me  facebook has  streamlined  the hiring process in order to be able to evaluate candidates very quickly. from my experience  this came off as unorganized and unprofessional. my final impression was that the interviewer did not thoroughly evaluated me as a candidate  but sufficed that i could answer 2 standard interview questions quickly and with explanation. compared to other companies i interviewed with during the same period  this interview was not rigorous enough to really determine quality.,given a telephone number  find all the permutations of the letters assuming 1 abc  2 def  etc.   3 answers
2010-12-09 00:14:47.383,my resume was submitted by an employee. i got a call from recruiter next day  she was nice and explained me the process  then scheduled me for phone interview within same week. she was nice enough to provide some interview tips  so i had chance to review some topics. i think fb recruiters are totally on your side. the phone interviewer was a very nice guy  he was definitely not a recent graduate like some other poster complained  he talked about the pre internet boom days  so i think he has least 15 years experience. the phone screen took 45 mins. first 10 15 mins  he asked about my background and why it s a good match for the position  why i want to work in fb. then i was asked to coding question to  find minimum depth of a binary search tree . it was not a hard question  any average coder could do it within 15 mins. i wrote the code with no hint or help from him. during the coding  he was mostly quite  at one point  he pointed out a possible bug which i fixed instantly. at the end  i was trying to optimize the code  he said the code would work  no need to optimize it further. then he let me ask questions about fb about 15 mins. after the interview  i compiled the code and it really worked  didn t even have a single compile error. next day  i received a rejection letter from the recruiter with no details. so trick is  writing the code is not enough  but your code must be very close the most optimized version known and you should be able to write  close to perfect  code in minimum time. i googled for similar algorithms and found out my solution was well above the average  but not the best one. i guess they expect you to write something very close to best available code possible can be written  so they single out best coders. so  move fast  break things ..,find the minimum depth of binary search tree   10 answers
2010-12-10 09:12:45.14,first i had a phone interview. the question was fairly straight forward  multiply two very large numbers given as strings  and the interviewer wasn t looking for any tricks or anything like that to solve. like others have mentioned  quick clean code seems to be the key. unfortunately  the interviewer had a very thick east asian accent and talking over the phone just made things worse. i had to ask him to repeat quite a few times. it was probably me but at times i couldn t even tell when he d asked a question because of the inflection  it must ve gone well enough though because i got an on site call. the on site was two interviews of 45 min each. in the first one  i took a bit of a hit because a  i couldn t see the solution right away b  it took me a while to get up to speed and code the thing   i did manage to finish it though and it seemed  relatively  bug free. again  as lots of people have mentioned  the interviewer seemed quite young  just a year or so out of school and he didn t offer much in terms of feedback   positive or negative   as the interview progressed. once he d given me the question and given me the hint that got me started  he was busy with his iphone  rarely looking up. that kinda sucked. the second interviewer was much nicer   probably one of the best ones i ve interviewed with   lots of feedback  lots of encouragement  was accepting of different trains of thought and non standard answers. seemed like a really nice guy too. overall  it seems to be the case with facebook that a  your interview really depends on who you get b  they seem to value quick clean bug free optimized code at the first try more than anything else c  questions are of average to above average difficulty  if you ve prepared  ,write a function to take a bst and a value k as input and have it print the kth smallest element in the bst.   5 answers write a function that takes a binary tree as input  and have it perform in order traversal   recursive and then iterative   answer question write a function to take two arbitrarily long numbers in the form of strings and multiply them  returning another string with the product.   1 answer write a function to calculate square root of a number   2 answers given a binary tree  write a function to find the length of the longest path in the tree.   8 answers

2010-10-25 08:42:57.03,i had on campus interviews in the spring and then decided to interview for full time in the fall. i had three interviews   the first went very well  the second was terrible  the third was alright. the terrible interviewer asked some basic technical questions involving writing code on the board. as i thought out loud  i asked the interviewer clarification questions and then ultimately asked whether i should start writing code on the board. the interviewer either did not respond to my questions or mumbled off a few incomprehensible words. i started writing code and as soon as i stepped back from the board  the interviewer pointed out my mistake without giving me a chance to assess the code myself. he did this an another two times for the subsequent questions. overall  the questions were not difficult at all. it seems that facebook wants to make sure that you code frequently enough that you do not make any errors on your first hack at a problem. this seems to fit the  go fast and break things  motto. although things didn t work out for me  i got an offer from google  so i guess that s not a bad second choice.,basic string operations  trees  sorting   answer question

2010-08-07 01:43:35.49,was originally contact by a recruiter over linkedin. i had a phone interview  followed by a visit to a facebook recruiting event where i met with an engineer in person  followed by another phone screen  followed by an on site in palo alto with 4 members of the engineering staff. the whole process seemed somewhat disorganized  i was informed after my recruiting event visit that i would be getting an on site as the next step  but was informed a couple of days later that i d have to do another phone screen first. the questions in the screens and the onsite seemed reasonable enough. i ll admit to having somewhat of an off day at the on site. i completely fumbled the  are there any bugs in your code  question with at least one of the interviewers  i said there wasn t  but there was a pretty obvious bug once he described the failure mode to me. there was a scheduling mix up with at least one of my interviewers  which caused my time with him to be cut short. i m sure that didn t help with him getting a good feel for me for the sake of his interview feedback. the culture seems a bit more corporatey than the recruiting buzz might put forward  it seems geared toward people who want to have one foot in the startup pond while having the other firmly planted on the dry land of large  relatively safe organization. there are a lot of small teams  and the reflection i got is that there is a non negligible amount of bureaucracy weighing on the organization. i guess when you get to 1000 people  that will happen. the office space is a mostly open floor plan  and the gear the developers are provided to work on is really good stuff. but that s an initial impression  and things are not always as they appear. so yeah  weirdness in the interview scheduling and such dragged down my impression  but i d probably give the dice another roll if the chance comes up again. if nothing else  it will allow me a second glimpse to either bolster or contradict my first impressions.,are there any bugs in your code    1 answer

2015-02-18 11:51:51.74,here s my opinion from my experience interviewing at facebook. they tell you the process in advance. one phone interview  5 in house interviews  3 coding  1 design and 1 behavioural . all interviews are 45 minutes each and one on one  and you have to write code in all of the coding interviews  and possibly in the design one too. in the first round  one person decides whether you get through or not. in the 5 rounds  each interviewer provides their feedback after you have finished the interviews which means that if you do badly in one then the other interviewers won t actually know. be fully aware  and make no mistake about this   there is an incredibly high possibility that you will get rejected. that sounds harsh but consider it from their position   huge numbers of people apply  huge numbers get interviewed  and they have to pick people out somehow. they also say that they prefer to avoid hiring the wrong person so ultimately they end up inadvertantly rejecting good candidates incase they turn out to be a bad hire  so the risk of getting rejecting is even higher. basically  this means you are most likely going to be wasting a ridiculous amount of your time and effort. perhaps because of this  they are incredibly nice and friendly. this really was the nicest and most pleasant interview i have had. also  once you understand the scenario  it really helps to kill your nerves if you suffer from that. after all  why stress about something you have practically no chance of succeeding in  negative  true  but the odds are really stacked against you and you would do well to understand that and just be yourself. the questions are not that hard  i found. in fact  i solved the first one so quickly i even surprised myself. you do have to write on the whiteboard  but that of course means that there can not be much code to write since a whiteboard is not that big. indeed the questions are not that hard really. i felt that they do expect you to talk about what you are doing but also to get it right very quickly and without any mistakes. they want to see how you approach the problem etc.  but get real   they don t want to see you fumbling around  they want to see that you know the answer and can bang it out. ultimately  even if you know the answer to the technical questions and you get them right you will still likely fail over something you can t really control or even know about. in my case  they said i didn t have management experience  but you know what  i didn t apply for a manager role and they never even asked about management or leadership at all. i was pretty annoyed to be honest  it felt like a complete waste of my time and i felt like an idiot for worrying so much about the interviews. they do provide you with some preparation links which are useful. there is also a book called cracking the coding interview. it doesn t have their questions in it of course  but it gives you plenty of examples on how to solve these kinds of questions so if you read up on it you should be able to bang them out quite easily. overall  it is worth going just to see if you can handle it because you probably can  just make sure that you feel good about what you achieved even if they say no.,make sure you can tell them what you actually did in your previous projects  not what the project was. know how to traverse data structures. know what the time space complexity is. seriously  it really isn t that hard but you do need to know it so well that you can literally write it flawlessly. they want to see that you arrive at the decision to use a tree hashtable graph whatever  but then they expect you to bang out that solution.   answer question

2015-02-26 12:01:57.407,no different to others mentioned here  contacted via linkedin  one screening call  45mins   then on site with 4 x 45mins interviews. overall  the algorithm questions are not particularly hard. i have interviewed with fb twice  and both times felt the sessions went well  although considerably better the second time   but no offer either time. you won t get detailed enough feedback to know where you might have tripped up  if anywhere  though. from their point of view  i think this is understandable  but makes it harder to deal with the rejection  if you had fouled up every session you would feel better than if you basically answered all the questions  with seemingly positive feedback from each interviewer  yet not got an offer... as noted elsewhere  it s probably best to be stoic about the whole thing and accept that they have so many candidates they probably apply a  benefit of the doubt  policy that works against in their favour  ie. i would imagine they employ a sort of  thumb up    thumb down  policy. they are  however  very pleasant and expect to have a positive experience of the process even if the result is not what you might want yourself.,one session of higher level design  the rest are all standard algorithm sessions. all of this is explained in advance  so no surprises. one on site session is a more traditional interview.   answer question

2014-02-08 05:06:42.087,i competed in a kaggle competition conducted by facebook. a few weeks after the competition ended i was contacted by a recruiter and asked a few basic questions via email. about a week after that the recruiter told me i was going to be interviewed. he also included a bunch of urls to read so i would be familiar with the facebook interview style. the interview was setup by a coordinator. two days later the interview took place over the phone. the interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself by discussing my favorite project. he said my resume was too extensive to discuss. i worked in silicon valley for 5 years and have a significant background in software engineering. there was no discussion of the kaggle competition. he then presented a puzzle. it involved a grid with the letters x  o  and g. x were walls  o were rooms  and g were guards. i had to create an algorithm that computed the the shortest path to each room from a guard. so if it took a guard 3 steps to reach a room  and another guard 2 steps  then you would only keep the 2. the grid was variable size  n x n . the task was to design the algorithm and then code it up in a shared web page. i had about 35 minutes to complete the puzzle. i wasn t able to get it completed. the next day i thought about it while eating lunch and the best way to solve it became clear. i was definitely on the right track during the interview  but it was simply incomplete. the puzzle itself wasn t amazingly hard. it s just the time constraints. i needed another 20 minutes or so to get it done right. a few days later i was told my background was not what they were looking for. this was a really strange thing to say because my background was never discussed. there is no doubt in my mind that my background is strong enough to work at facebook. as a matter of fact  after seeing the skills of the interviewing engineer  i looked him up on linkedin   i feel i m over qualified. a few observations... this was the first time i ve been interviewed by someone with significantly less experience than myself. your past experience is irrelevant. i could have helped steve jobs invent the iphone but if you can t solve the puzzle then you ll be passed over. while i was working on the puzzle the interviewer gave me a  tip . it turns out that the tip was incorrect. i m 100  positive that using an efficient solution is completely incompatible with the tip he gave me. maybe it was part of the test. if you re good at puzzles and have a solid understand of software development  but not a lot of experience  then you should go apply. my personal impression is that they re looking for younger less experienced people. my interviewer started out as an intern so that seems to be a good alternative if you re still in college.,No Question

2012-07-22 20:18:39.28,i was contacted by a recruiting agency for software engineering position at facebook  and after i told them i was willing to apply  my resume was forwarded to facebook s recruiter. next day  i got an email from the fb recruiter with a link to an online coding test on interviewstreet. this test was for one hour duration  designed to test coding skills of the interviewer. it was a string parsing problem and code could be written in any language and we d just need to submit the output on a given input set. i got an email later from the facebook people that i passed that test and would need to do a phone interview. my phone interview was scheduled in a week. an engineer called me up for the phone interview and asked about my work projects. i explained to him briefly and also got to know a little about his work at facebook. he then followed onto the technical interviewing part and posed a problem for me. we were working on a shared document for this part. this was a problem about the classic binary search tree data structure  like an rb tree. i coded a simple solution and i was asked to analyse its runtime complexity. i analysed the complexity and was able to put it in big o notation. he was satisfied with that solution and then moved onto talking about his work  what facebook is expecting from the candidates and such. the conversation quickly ended after that . a couple weeks later  their recruiter informed me that i passed the phone interview and would be scheduled personal interviews. about a month after my phone interview  it was the day for the personal interviews and i was flown into their interviewing location. i had two technical interviews that day and another general  informal get to know you and your work type of interview. for technical interviews  code was to be written on a whiteboard. in one of the technical interviews  i was told to come up with an algorithm for a variation of the classic knapsack problem. this could be solved with a dynamic programming and i coded the same on the whiteboard. it s important to explain how the solution was arrived at. after coding it up  i was asked to analyse its complexity. i d written a recursive solution and i could only write a recurrence relation for the complexity function  not a closed form. i also told him that an interative solution is also possible and wrote it out too. being an iterative code  with a simple nested loop  it was also easy to analyse its complexity. the interviewer was actually ok with the recurrence relation for the complexity and didn t bug me on an exact form. he seemed satisfied with my solution and then we moved onto general topics. interview was quickly over after that. for the second technical interview  i was asked a problem on balanced binary search trees. i d previously implemented an rb tree and that experience helped me very much for this interview. without this experience  i couldn t have solved that problem and would ve been rejected. i was asked the classic interview problem on sorted but rotated array. i knew the solution for this one and it involved binary search. i wrote the solution for this one and the interview was quickly over after that. i was told to provide 3 personal references on that day and left for home. about 2 weeks later  i was informed that there would be another technical interview. in this interview  i was asked to implement a simple regex parser. conceptually  some what simpler than the other interviews  but getting the implementation correct was tricky for this one. i got it right and he was satisfied with the code. i was also then asked about the runtime complexity for the solution. i left the interview confidently. a week later  i was offered the job. generally speaking  good programming skills help a lot in getting this job. on top of that  i d suggest reading the cs algorithms textbook by cormen. writing good code  with a clear understanding of its complexity is a must.,about my college education.   3 answers

2010-09-04 00:13:45.94,i was contacted by the facebook recruiter saying i need to solve one of the puzzle from the facebook puzzles to start the interview process. i had solved one problem and then recruiter scheduled my phone interview. the interview was good. the guy at the other end was nice and smart. the interview last for around 1 hr. it start by asking me about myself. he asked me about my choice between three platforms  linux kernel  mysql  java script . i had chosen mysql and he asked me why did i choose mysql. other questions are described below. i got response from the recruiter that they would like to keep me on hold  as they are finding difficulty in judging with large number of candidates. i answered all questions correctly  i feel  except my written code  took around 10 to 15 mins  for the problem had one bug which he had noticed correctly and told me to resolve it. after resolving it he gave me the green signal. one of the big problem  i guess one of the main factor in the interview  i faced that as i am ok with english  i was finding difficulty in understanding his accent. so many times the interviewer had to repeat his questions. lastly he asked me if i have any questions for them. i asked one question. this is how end my phone interview with facebook.,you are going to take some numbers as an input from a file. you need to witer a program to find longest increasing sequence. you should process it as soon as you are taking an input. after finishing the last input immediately you should be able to tell the sequence. input  1 5 3 4 6 4 output  3 4 6   5 answers a file contains 10 billions of strings and need to find duplicate strings. you have n number of systems available. how will you find duplicates    2 answers
2010-09-02 07:18:56.46,an hr contacted me and said i should complete one of their three hardest puzzles. the puzzle was interesting  but the fact that i spent 2.5 days to do that  1 day was spent on submitting it in a correct way so that the puzzle robot accepts it   and it won t help when interviewing anywhere else  annoyed me. i then had a phone interview. the guy was very clever  which was nice. the questions were  what is the most exciting project you had  and white a function to multiply two arbitrarily large integers. i spent quite a while writing a recursive solution for the problem  made some mistakes during that  but fixed those purely by myself. the interviewer did not provide any feedback during the process when i described my  way of thinking  and the programming  so i even had to ask whether he was on the line. with phone interview  not feedback is a bit too harsh  imho. then i was asked to write an iterative solution  and i completed it as well. i did not write the solutions easily  and my way of explaining was not perfectly clear and great  but i solved what i was asked. then the hr contacted me saying they won t consider me anymore this year. i politely asked for feedback  but got the answer that there is nothing to share. quite surprising for a social oriented company.,describe the most exciting project.   answer question write a function to multiply two arbitrarily large integers.   5 answers
