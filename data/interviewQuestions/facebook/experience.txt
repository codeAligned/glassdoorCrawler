I was local to the Facebook offer so they did the screens in person. The first one did not go very well, but went well enough to get a second chance (as opposed to a full interview). The second one went better and I was invited back for a full day of interviews. They were able to rush the process since I had other offers. The full day interview was 4 interviews. 1 system design question, 1 manager interview ("Tell me about a time..."), 2 algorithms questions. Everyone was welcoming and enthusiastic, so that made the stressful process easier. I got a call from the recruiter about 4 days later telling me they were not moving forward with an offer. A bit disappointing and it wasn't entirely clear why as I thought the interview went well. I was interviewing for a smaller office so maybe that made a difference.

I applied to Facebook through their website and got a call from the recruiter the next day. He asked the standard screening questions and set up a technical phone screen for later that week. The phone screen was done using coderpad.io, and they threw me off from the very beginning by setting up a C++ environment although I had told the recruiter that I was most comfortable in Python and although I never claimed anywhere that I had any familiarity with C++. Still, interview questions tend to be general enough that, as long as you aren't completely unfamiliar with the language syntax, you can generally do a decent job in any language. So off we went in C++. The interviewer was very pleasant, and even gave me some tips for how to improve my resume at the beginning. Then we dived into the coding. He had actually chosen a great question to determine my programming ability. Unfortunately, I botched it by making too many assumptions about the question and not considering carefully enough what lay behind the interface that the interviewer had provided me. This all happened maybe two or three weeks ago and I am sure that I won't be progressing to the next step. The one negative in all this is that the recruiter has not followed up at all with me. Yes, rejection is not uncommon when applying at a company like Facebook, but that doesn't mean that the company shouldn't have the courtesy to at least inform you of it. So overall, great experience in the beginning but I was turned off by the lack of respect for the process that I sensed from the recruiter.

I was contacted by a recruiter and had a phone chat with her the next day. After a week, I went to to the in-house interview. I arrived 5 minutes before the scheduled time and I waited for 20 minutes in the reception area. My scheduled interviewer could not make it and they found a young engineer to interview me instead. He is friendly and has worked in the industry for only 2 years. The conversation started almost like I was the interviewer as he introduced himself and told me what he does at Facebook for about 5 minutes. He asked me what I do in my current project and proceeded with a coding question. I solved the question in Java, tested edge cases, modularized the solution and discussed other potential solutions I could think of. We had a nice conversation and the interviewer agreed the solution given was good. He ended the interview by giving me the opportunity to ask any questions. They did not proceed to the next stage with me and I was surprised. Obviously I missed something and I do not know what that is. I asked the recruiter for feedback via e-mail and did not hear back.

Asked a friend to refer me. Was contacted by a recruiter within two days. Quickly scheduled a tech-screen (essentially mini-ninja interview). After that came the on-site loop. 2 ninja, 2 pirate and 1 jedi interviews. Can't share specific questions, but plenty of other people did already. Unlike Google (interviewed with them also), Facebook seems to have a smaller question pool as one of the system design questions I got I've also seen on Glassdoor before. I recommend going through the information recruiters provide for interview preparation. Since Google and Facebook use very similar processes, "Stevey's Blog Rants: Get that job at Google" post is also quite relevant and useful. Know your data-structures, algorithms, practice solving problems for a few weeks and you should be in good shape. For system design questions, you will be asked to design Facebook-scale systems. Think data way beyond the scope of one machine, billions of items, thousands of requests per second. Hands on experience with such systems is of course "the king". In the absence of that - study distributed NoSQL systems, MapReduce and similar things and you should be in good shape. Overall I was very happy with the on-site interviews and the level of support Facebook recruiters and engineers provided me. This was probably the best interview experience that I've had. Having a competing offer handy will surely help you negotiate better compensation. Facebook seems to have an awesome culture. Deciding to reject their very generous offer for another one wasn't an easy call. One really can't go wrong by joining Facebook. Facebook is the only company that I know that provides interview feedback. Regardless whether you pass or not I recommend asking for it as it will help you get better.

I've applied through an employee referral and got a ping from the recruiter in about a week. After the initial chat with the recruiter to chat about FB, my interests and logistics, I got scheduled for the initial 45-minute screening. I was given two options for the screen, either phone/codeshare or an onsite visit (likely an option available for local candidates only). I chose the in-person option, and got an invite for a round of full day (5 total) within few hours after the initial screen. Facebook recruiters send interview prep materials to the candidates on what to expect, what to brush up on, as well as some suggestions tailored to a particular candidate's weak-ish spots (in my case it was the speed of coding). I knew what to expect going in and felt well prepared on this front. Initial screen was algorithm + coding. Nothing overly challenging. Onsite consisted of 5 interviews (+ informal lunch) covering: 1) One "Jedi" interview with a hiring manager testing behavior / culture fit + warm-up coding. Prepare to talk about past experience, career goals, as well as several "tell me about the time when..." questions. 2) One "Pirate" interview: System design portion of the interview. There are great resources on Quora on suggestions on how to prepare and what to pay attention too. 3) Three "Ninja" interviews focusing on algorithm + coding. I actually have seen all of the questions I got asked at Facebook before, but that did not help me as ultimately the reason for rejection was cited as not being able to come up with optimal solutions and code fast enough. Got an phone call from the recruiter in about a week+few days after the interview telling me the unfortunate news. I think I had to wait few extra days because of the July holidays and typically the process is faster. Culture: I did find some of the junior Facebook engineers conducting my interview a bit arrogant and cocky, but nothing too alarming. All in all, I had a positive interview experience. I wish the interview loop was better tailored towards someone more senior, e.g. less emphasis on coding, more on design. Current interview process makes it seem they hire code monkeys.

I can't discuss specifics due to NDA, but interview questions were neither overly difficult nor tricky. Check careercup and brush up on algorithms (string processing, binary trees, graphs, etc.). Practice coding fast (which potentially means forgetting good software engineering practices such as class design, refactoring as it will only slow you down). Establish rapport with your interviewer, remember to ask clarifying questions, talk through your thinking process and solutions and you'll do well. Hopefully better than me:) Best of luck!   Answer Question

If you're a solid developer with years of experience working on high visibility products used by millions of people (and references to back it up) don't expect the interview process at Facebook to just work. It really comes down to how much you prepare yourself mentally to code within the context of an interview, and how much you study Career Cups as well as the other resources given to you by the recruiter. Sadly, you don't have to be a great developer at all. What's interesting is that none of these skills have been necessary during my 17 years of real world experience. I never had to write code on a whiteboard (except for other interviews) and I don't see how "writing code fast" should be considered a measurement of someone's productivity and code quality. That sort of thinking seems naive and haphazard to me. What frightens me is that I think Facebook truly believes they're "raising the bar" with this system. But they're not always hiring good people, and they're probably turning down a lot of great folks. The coding tests were super easy. Two were questions I've actually asked myself while conducting interviews for another company which was aimed towards entry level developers. I really wish they would have asked more challenging questions. I was able to finish them before the end of each panel, and with optimal solution. The design question they gave me actually aligned with something I developed and designed for a product used by millions. I felt good with how everything went at the end of the day, but somehow I failed at *both* coding and design. Interesting... whatever. Two of my friends--whom of which I mentored at my last company--were able to get offers at Facebook (same office, same interview process) but they were *not* the best coders nor the top performers, so if you get turned down at Facebook, don't take it seriously. They say there is some "randomness" in the interview, but it just seems strange that common sense didn't kick anywhere to question the obvious, or just the fact I was interviewed by a few people with only 5 years experience. Smart, but inexperienced (and somewhat arrogant) wanting to judge you with entry level coding questions. Half of the people that interviewed me didn't go through the interview process themselves. They were brought in by acquisitions. Specifically for a product that isn't doing very well right now. I was excited about the idea of working there initially, but after the interview, I wasn't so sure anyway. They do try to put a lot of emphasis on finding great developers, but many of the folks who interviewed me mentioned the codebase was a mess (probably from writing code so quickly and not thinking through it) And their open office (no cubes, no walls, just wires and computers everywhere) is a bit distracting. Not something genuinely appreciated by the people working there who used to have their own office. When you need to focus and get quality work done, there are only so many dedicated rooms to use and they're usually taken. Coupled with the fact that they're Seattle office is located in one of the worst traffic areas, I wasn't so sure I would have accepted anyway.

I started off with a standard technical phone screen with a Facebook engineer. It was a simple coding exercise with two questions of surprisingly low difficulty. I cleared this easily. Facebook's on-site interview process is far more rigorous, though. Each 45-min interview has a clearly defined role, intended to test you from multiple different angles. Specifically, I went through: - 2 "Ninja" interviews (coding & algorithms) - 2 "Pirate" interviews (system design) - 1 "Jedi" interview (behavioral & simple coding) plus lunch with a Facebook engineer. The "Ninja" and "Jedi" interviews were straightforward. I hadn't seen the coding questions before, but they were not particularly hard. I would rate them as being of just average difficulty, pretty similar to the whiteboard coding questions asked at most other major Silicon Valley tech companies. And the behavioral section of the "Jedi" interview was just a friendly chat about my resume and my past experiences. However, the "Pirate" interviews were what killed me. Both "Pirate" interviews involved being asked to propose and discuss a design for existing features on Facebook. The interviewers were extremely meticulous and questioned me on virtually every last detail of my design decisions. In particular, they focused a lot on how huge datasets should be stored and accessed to support extremely large-scale distributed systems. Even though I am already working on web-scale systems in my current job, I was nonetheless still way under-prepared for this level of technical challenge and scrutiny. My advice to all prospective candidates is to spend most of your time preparing for the "Pirate" interviews. The coding questions aren't hard, but the system design questions will likely stretch you to your limit! (Unless you're a fresh grad--they don't ask "Pirate" questions to fresh grads. Lucky folks!) Additional side note: interestingly, my Facebook recruiter actually gave me detailed post-mortem feedback on each and every one of my interviews. They are the only major Silicon Valley company I know that does this, so major kudos to them for being so considerate.

Can't disclose due to NDA. But as mentioned above, the coding questions are really straightforward and of merely average difficulty. It's the system design ("Pirate") questions that can be really, really challenging. Definitely spend a good portion of your time preparing for the latter!   Answer Question

Recruiter contacted me on Linkedin. I requested for in person interview in place of telephonic. Arranged a 1 hour interview at Menlo park office. Cleared the interview and was called for a six round interview. Interview was strange. Easy and not so complex algorithmic rounds. Not sure what is so special about those rounds or whether they were even part of the decision making. Interviewers were happy with the answers and not much corrections. Then there were these design rounds. One of the rounds was about designing location services. The interviewer was very knowledgeable. Pointed out my in-efficiencies with the choice of data-structure. Enjoyed it. Then started the real fun in the final round. An awesome interviewer with an awesome attitude. He spoiled my interview experience though. Asked me to design a messaging app system. Once the interviewer breaks the comfort zone, it would be a difficult place to stand. His expressions were horrible and sometimes I felt like saying "shut-up and listen first" which I didn't say obviously. When I mentioned that the server knows the ip address of client only when the server receives a packet from client. He said, there are a lot other ways it happens. I mentioned the only way is clients packet to the server. He made it an argument and finally I had to ask him to mention a way. He skipped the part and asked me to move on :-D Ignoring the final round, I actually enjoyed the interview process. No offer though :-)

First, there was a phone screen with the recruiter, a technical screen (either phone or on site, candidate's choice), and an on site. The recruiter was very professional and helpful, describing the process and the engineering culture at Facebook. They were very flexible in scheduling both the phone screen and onsite. The phone screen was a standard technical phone screen, with the difficulty dialed up slightly. The solutions allowed were constrained (typically, constant space). After I presented my solution, we discussed its complexity. The on site was very similar. The interview was very CS heavy. The questions asked relied on the knowledge of the properties of many data structures, including ones that are less often used. I can't recall any technical trivia questions being asked; all the questions surrounded a problem with an implementation that had to be coded on the white board. Parallelism and threads were also covered. I gave my answers in Python, and except for one interviewer that asked for a solution using Java, all accommodated. There was one design and architecture review which as different and a lot of fun. I was asked to design a system for a current feature of Facebook. The interviewers were great to interact with. I had a couple offers that were exploding, and they said they would be able to get a decision back quick. But there was an offsite, so the decision was delayed a few days. I withdrew when I accepted another offer. To put it in context, my other offers were exploding within 72 hours of the on site, so it was a tall order and it's to their credit that they tried. I left very impressed. When I'm looking for a position in the future, I'll definitely check them out.

Onsite interview process was fair. Difficulty level was average. First person to interview me had horrible communication skills. He couldn't explain coding problem clearly. Remaining three people were very good in communication. After on-site interview, facebook requested for yet another coding phone interview. Post onsite phone interview is what went wrong with me. This person had poor interview skills. He asked me an advanced algorithm question about graph/tree traversal (search for "same fringe problem concurrency" and you will know what I am talking about). I gave a natural solution which was not space efficient, but interviewer was looking for a specific solution he had in mind. I lost the deal to this question. I would give thumbs up to recruiters handling interview process. I think they are one of the best in the industry.

Took multiple months as I was not available. The recruiter did an excellent job in making sure that I take the interview. The interview took 45 mins and started with details about my previous work experience. That took about 20 mins and then I was left with 20 mins for the programming question. He gave me a problem related to BST. Obviously I need to draw the tree etc and he cannot see that on phone interview. I started with multiple approaches and he told specifically what I need to do eg. give only recursive solution, you can only store few things no extra space. In the end i was able to solve with a minor hint and he was also telling me to fix bugs as I was coding as well indent code as per his standards. Overall it was a good experience but I did not get the offer as they are looking for people who can code in like 10 mins as I was able to code in 15-20 mins. They want bug free code and will only go forward with the best candidate. I think even if you do a minor mistake you are out as there is someone else who will solve it perfectly so try to solve it perfectly :) Another important lesson is if you get option of phone v/s in person interview, I will say go for in person interview as it gives the interviewer the chance to see what you are doing on paper verses imagining that over phone.

I applied on facebook site, and was contacted not so long after, told to schedule a date for an interview. I was called exactly the time given, interviewer went straight to the point. He gave a very brief introduction about himself and we went straight to coding. He asked me just one question but I couldn't give the right answer as I did not go over some basic data structures. I would advice that if you have an interview for any SWE, you should go over everything!

Met recruiter at the Facebook offices, she showed me around. Because I was applying for an engineering position, it started on the engineering floor, which isn't too big. Nice offices but nothing super special, she did mention they were moving fairly soon. After the brief tour went down to the 2nd floor and went to a small room for the technical screen. An engineer came in and for a minute or two asked me about my background and work experience. Then went and asked me two technical questions. The first one was pretty straight forward, but I spent a long time explaining my thought process and debugging and everything. (As a ton of sites say you do). Second one was a bit more of a puzzle question and stumbled a little on it, basically it was a binary search algorithm. Unfortunately a miscommunication at the beginning of the question caused me to try to think of it in a different direction, but eventually got it and realized time was up so I quickly coded the solution and debugged it, but didn't explain myself probably because I knew the time was up. Ultimately got both questions right with a minor stumble and then was not asked for a further interview, so I really have no idea why, and unfortunately I understand for legal ramifications why they can't tell me. However not getting past the screen was unexpected.

Process: This is for undergrad full-time software candidates in USA. Submitted resume at college career fair. Got email about on-campus interviews. At this stage, there are 3 possible outcomes: onsite invitation, a phone interview for an additional chance, or reject. I was invited to onsite interview. Onsite was a "University Day" that included three interviews (not four like they said in the email) before lunch and then a tour, new-hire panel, etc after lunch. All interviews were 45-mins length. Interviews themselves: On-campus interview: 3 coding questions. I don't remember signing any NDA at this point so, the questions were k-Nearest Points to Origin, finding a substring, and 3-sum. On-site interview: 3 interviews, 45 mins each. 1st interview: 2 coding questions. 2nd interview: behavioral questions (about team conflict, etc.) and a coding question. 3rd interview: 2 coding questions. Coding questions were easy and required *no knowledge* of special algorithms or data structures (such as graphs, DP, trees, etc). Recursion and strings were common. I did not get an offer from Facebook; however, I received offers from other companies. The interview questions themselves were considerably easier at Facebook than those asked at Google, LinkedIn, MS, Amazon, etc. Since the questions are not very hard, my guess is the decision is based upon fit and most importantly how *quickly* you were able to arrive at your solution and how *perfect* your code was. Make sure you focus and are confident. Advice: practice the easier questions and practice coding them. Also, looking at some of the other experiences on Glassdoor, it looks like a majority of the questions are re-used.

I had two technical interviews (they are not back-to-back, with about a two-week interval) plus one team matching interview on the phone. The whole process took 4~5 weeks. In both tech. interviews, there were two simple algorithm problems. My interviewer shared me a link on collabedit and I just coded there. All questions were quite basic and nothing surprising happened.

Onsite tech screen followed by 4 1:1 rounds. Three of the technical rounds were on coding questions and one of them had a design problem. Most of the technical problems were easy but I didn't code well probably because I didn't take enough time to practice whiteboard coding. The design round had an interesting problem. I'll probably appear in this once more in a year. All interviewers were good and well-behaved. The process was smooth as well.

I'm local to Facebook HQ, so for the initial screening interview I was given the option to do it over the phone or onsite (I chose the latter). The interviewer asked me about my recent work history, and asked me to solve a couple of coding problems. I returned a couple of weeks later for 5 onsite interviews, which consisted of 2 coding, 2 design, and 1 fit interview.

Recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn. Had a chat on the phone and decided to mutually move ahead. The first round was a basic phone round with a software engineer ( nothing too difficult ). Cleared it and came onsite. As known, the pattern onsite is one behavioral interview with a coding question followed by 2 coding interviews and 1 design interview. Will not disclose the onsite questions due to NDA. The behavioral interview person was yawning throughout the 40 minutes and the coding interview question asked at the end of the behavioral interview was one of those questions which you either know/ don't know. I was expected to know the solution and code it in 10 minutes which pretty much negated the problem solving aspect of it. The 2 coding round questions were pretty standard. However, one of the questions was a text book question and I stated that I knew the solution to that question following which the question asked was way too tough to be solved in 25 minutes on the white board. Similarly the design interview involved a lot of math and was more difficult than coming up with an architecture . This had been informed prior to the interview though. Overall : The interview experience was mixed probably because most of the questions seemed to be the type of questions that one would/ wouldn't know. There was very little problem solving aspect to the whole process and sadly that is pretty much the case with some interviews for tech companies

I didn't end up getting an offer. Due to NDA I cannot explicitly write down the questions, but look at the last 150 questions in Glassdoor and CareerCup and you'll do fine (I did fine in the coding rounds, get to that in a bit). Usual advice: Do a lot of white-boarding for questions and be ready to talk extensively about your projects and architecture and design. Screening Round: I applied to Facebook by getting connected to a recruiter through a colleague and friend. The process started in Seattle and I opted for a in-person onsite interview for the screening round (they have this option for locals in Seattle/California). The interview went well i.e. I figured out how to solve the question in optimal time and space complexity. I made some mistakes here and there while writing the solution down but the interviewer didn't seem to mind. Contrary to what I had heard, he wasn't too anal about syntax (also helped that I write in C# he wasn't very familiar with it) Onsite Round: I received an email from the recruiter that they wanted to move forward and call me onsite. I was like, cool! I took around 2 weeks to prepare and also tried to do design questions. I felt a bit under prepared around design and tried to make up for it in the last few weeks by watching videos around cloud architecture (and open source stuff like Hadoop, Kafka and Storm). Onsite was pretty straightforward. First round was a career fit/discussion and I did pretty well (I think). It was mainly some behavioral questions and a lot diagrams around the architecture in my current and previous projects. Second round was the one that I messed up. The question was around designing an existing Facebook feature (as a hint, think about the various add-dons you see on FB and instagram like Chat, Search, latest friend related news or popular links). When you really dig into designing this feature, its quite complicated and requires a reasonable amount of knowledge around distributed data storage etc. etc. You need to nail this round to get into Facebook (in my personal opinion). I'm guessing they will adjust their expectations based on your years of experience. There was a lunch which was informal and two more coding rounds where they asked questions that were very similar to the ones I had practiced. I made some silly mistakes here and there but again (due to practice) came up with optimal time/space complexity answers. Got my result exactly one week from the my onsite date. No offer. But learnt a lot.

Was contacted by facebook recruiter. I thought I will give it a try. I selected in person tech screen vs phone interview since I think it is much easier to express yourself in person, plus there is whiteboard. Especially, if it is a graph or tree problem, easier to draw on whiteboard. I had to sign NDA unfortunately, so won't be able to share the exact question. But for a software engineer (not senior), the question was pretty hard to solve in 40 minutes. Backtracking was required and the best solution to the problem is n! (n factorial). So if you haven't heard of the problem before, it is quite likely you will spend time just on finding an optimal solution before jumping to code. That's what I did. However, I was able to code most of the solution and interviewer seemed happy. He himself told me that. Interviewer was pretty nice. He answered my questions pretty well and seemed down to earth, only thing I am not sure is the choice of question. I was informed that they will not move ahead with the on-site round, which is what I expected.

I was originally contacted by a recruiter after I submitted my application through a University Grad portal. 1. 45 minute on-campus interview with a technical question and some general fit questions. 2. Flew out to their Seattle office for University Day. There were three 45 minute interviews: One behavioral interview (Jedi) and two coding interviews (Ninja). The coding interviews covered fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms. I signed an NDA so I can't tell you about specific questions, but you don't need to review very specialized information. Just make sure you know the basic data structures/algorithms and how to apply them. 3. A week later, I received an offer and accepted. The Facebook recruiters are by far the most helpful and efficient recruiters that I've ever worked with. Most e-mails are responded to within a few hours and made me feel very comfortable throughout the process.

I was first contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. We had a quick chat on the phone before he scheduled a phone screen with an engineer. I don't remember the question from the phone screen, but it was a standard coding screening type interview of about 30 minutes. There was a little bit of time for other questions, but the focus was entirely on coding ability. A few days later, the recruiter contacted me again and arranged for an on site interview in Seattle. I had four approximately hour long interviews with a shorter lunch interview part of the way through. Although the interviews were themed (e.g., "pirate", "ninja", etc.), all were very focused on coding except for one which focused on architecting a system. Several of the coding questions required figuring out the trick underlying the problem in order to get a good solution quickly. Many other companies have stopped asking these kinds of questions since they've found they are not very good at identifying the best people to hire. I felt like I reached satisfactory solutions for each of the questions, but based on feedback I received from the recruiter afterward it was clear they would have preferred me to have been faster. Everybody I interviewed with was friendly and fairly organized, but the sole emphasis on coding and problem solving questions turned me off to the interview process. While it's important to suss out a candidate's technical abilities, these questions don't do a very good job of that. Moreover, they completely ignore other qualities a senior engineer needs to succeed such as cultural fit, leadership abilities, ability to motivate/influence others, having vision, etc. Overall it felt like the process was overly tailored towards entry level college hires instead of mid-career professionals with existing experience. I did not get an offer, but would not have accepted anyways.

They only gave me one technical question in each round but in the first round after I had solved the first question, they gave me the same problem but with the constraint that I couldn't use a hashmap.

Applied for an iOS position - was initially contacted via LinkedIn. Overall really enjoyed the process. Was quite drawn out due to personal circumstances. Interviewed from Australia, initially a phone screening interview (5 fairly basic iOS questions, understanding blocks and ARC), followed by 2 technical phone interviews (algorithmic coding questions plus verbal conversations around past work experience and also technical iOS questions. After passing in these two phone interviews they flew me out to Menlo Park for a day of interviews. There were 5 interviews, one initial chat to warm up, talking about past experience, working relationships, etc, and a brief coding question on the whiteboard. There were 3 more technical interviews of same format as the initial phone interviews. Plus one interview on designing scalable iOS app architecture for a simple app. I really enjoyed the process and found the recruiters very helpful and friendly. Going and visiting Facebook HQ was great and as the reviews say all the people were great. Recommend doing for the experience. Getting an offer is tough. For me it came down to not being quick enough in answering the questions in the onsite technical interviews. They weren't overly difficult but they want you to move fast, and I tended to take my time and discuss with the interviewers which I believe worked against me. The other aspect was a general lack of experience (I have 18 months experience), and this reflected especially in the iOS design interview. Hope this helps others considering going through the process! I definitely recommend it!

For each involved finding the solution (easy to optimal) and then write code optimal solution. I did this pretty well as I had prepared for data structures and algos. They immediately called me for full day onsite interview. Again I prepared lot on data structures, algorithms and related problem solving. And boom..that was my mistake. I forgot to focus on system side (locking, synchronization, deadlock) in detail. 5 interviewers, 45 min each. No on asked on data structures/algo. Two interviewers asked on locking related question, 1 design, 1 manager and last guy did combo of everything. Mostly I screwed up on locking related questions as I took many hint and long time... sigh.. Everyone was professional. Communication was prompt and fast!

Very technical questions. Be sure to review your data structures, sorting algorithms, and syntax without a reference. They don't care much about syntax, but it might trip you up during whiteboarding. They were extremely friendly, put you up in a hotel and take good care of you during the interview. I think there were many opportunities to ask questions and learn more about the specific problems they're trying to solve.

I had two coding phone interviews but did not move forward to the team matching interview. For each round, a engineer first introduced himself ask a little bit about your experience. Then they go to coding questions directly. I perform good at first round but not that good at second round.

The coding questions are not that hard for both two rounds. In the first round, the two questions are (1) return the sum of the k-largest digits ([0-9]) in the array (2) implement a LRU cache (least recently used) In the second round, the two questions are (1) return the index of the largest element, if more than one element reaches max, pick one unifromly at random; (2) clone a graph. the graph is directed, unweighted and not necessarily fully connected.   Answer Question

Facebook's interview process is to start you off with a one hour high pressure interview to solve two problems. If you pass that test then you come back for a full day. Facebook is well known for their interview arrogance and it proved to be quite true. The first part was a "white board architecture" problem where "want to see what you are thinking" - which is definitely not true. What they want to see is the exact answer/response that they are looking for. The second part is a coding question where you have to write code on a whiteboard using the language of your choice. The interviewer will have asked this question over and over and over again but then act like they are such an expert on the topic. You as the interviewer are going to have to think about it - since you do not have the same luxury as the interviewer. It is a typical facebook, google type interview where they claim to "set the bar high" to make themselves appear like a dream place to work.

I applied through career fair at my university. They hosted a pre-interview dinner so you can meet with your recruiter/on-campus interviewer. The next day I had my 45-min interview and it was a pleasant one. The question wasn't that hard and I didn't need any extra hint to solve it. After that they sent me an onsite request (wait for 1 week), then I came to their HQ in MPK a week later. Had the interview by noon, then a good tour around campus. The onsite question was much easier, as I think if you're invited to onsite then be confident that you have a really good chance to get in. After 2 business day I got the offer from FB. The compensation is really huge and very hard to decline. As for tip, I would say get as much rest and be well prepared for the interview. They ask basic question but you need to have a clear mind to solve them comfortably, and please try as hard as you can to explain the thought process.

I was contacted by a recruiter, I came onsite for an initial screen. I thought the interviewer was very nice, and the question was reasonable. However, the frustrating part for me was that for the given question, there were a few different ways to solve it. From my perspective, it seemed that the approach I used to solve the question was not what the interviewer had in mind. I understand that you should listen to an interviewer when they interrupt you or give you hints, but to me it seemed like the "hints" were basically from the perspective of "you're not solving this the way I would solve it, even though both of our solutions are O(n)". The result was that I was basically having to write out a problem on a white board and constantly have my train of thought interrupted. The interruptions were unnecessary, and I had to clarify to the interviewer that my intent would indeed work. Example interruption: Interviewer: "That array index is giving you the same result as the other value" Me: "No, that's a different variable name" Interviewer: "Oh, oops. Continue" or Interviewer: "Wait, why are you replacing the for loop with a while loop?" Me: "Because I want to be able to manipulate the cursor directly" Interviewer: "Oh, ok. Continue" In the above statement, it's clear that the usual method of solving the problem did not involve a while loop (but it could be done to solve the problem). After my solution, the interviewer explained the most straightforward solution to the problem which basically leveraged the constraints of the problem itself, and after seeing that then of course the problem was trivial to implement. So to me, it seemed like the question was more of a riddle than a coding exercise, which I believe to be a bad interview question, and at my current company it's accepted as the WORST type of interview question. It was rather embarrassing for me to be turned down, especially on just the initial screen, but another qualm I had was that screens are generally meant to filter out candidates that can't code at all, not candidates who are questionable in their skills (from my perspective my skills aren't questionable, but clearly I did not give my best performance in this screen). To me it felt as though the interviewer in this case did not have much experience. While I was answering the questions that were given to me, I was having to explain a few quirks to the python language that the interviewer clearly did not know i.e. "Oh, I didn't know you could compare dictionaries like that". For that to be said, I can only infer that the ONLY thing this interviewer was looking for is if I answer the question that was given to me in the exact way they wanted it solved.

I applied through a referral, 1 Skype interview (2 were scheduled but I didn't make it past the first one). The interviewer briefly introduced himself and asked me a coding question straight away. I chose to use Java. No behavioral questions, just 1 coding question. Contrary to what most people have said, I got an interviewer who wasn't very friendly. He was there to do his job. Plain and simple.

Before I get to the question I just want to say that the interviewer had a very thick accent (I'm an international candidate, BTW), and that made it really difficult for me to understand what he wanted me to do. This isn't me being bitter. I'm saying this so that I present a very honest opinion about my interview. That being said, the question wasn't something that can be found online or in most books, I was given 2 functions String recv() and String ReadLine() [ both these DO NOT take arguments]. recv() generates some string (Example:"123\n45\n6789"). ReadLine() should read the string being returned by recv() and print all characters until the first \n. After that it should read the recv() string again and print the next characters until the 2nd \n. Example: recv(): "123\n45\n6789" ReadLine(): "123" //first call of ReadLine ReadLine(): "45" // second call of ReadLine However, the next sequence now doesn't have a \n. So, once the end of the string is hit, the ReadLine() function must call recv() again, and append all characters until it reads a \n. Continuing the above example: ReadLine():6789abcde //Third call of ReadLine recv():"abc"// still no \n...so you must call recv() again recv():"de\n" The commented sections are my explanations (the interviewer didn't give any such things). I've explained the problem as clearly as I can. Unfortunately, the interviewer kept overwriting his examples, and (I have to emphasize this) his accent made it really hard to understand just what he wanted out of this program.   1 Answer

I applied online to the Facebook website in January. Facebook was really, absurdly fast for me. For the online application, they responded in about a week, and I scheduled the interview in the next week. After two phone interviews, they emailed me back in the same day. The interviewers were programmers, and they made me feel very comfortable. With other companies, I sometimes would get interviewers who knew nothing about programming, and it made it hard for me to talk about my projects without accidentally going into too much depth or jargon that they likely wouldn't understand. It was really comfortable talking with the Facebook interviewers, and it was easy to ask questions at the end because I knew they'd know about stuff like the Oculus or what programming life was like there. Like many others have said, I would highly recommend Cracking the Coding Interview. The questions were relatively easy, and two of them were ones I already saw on this site. My interviewers really liked that I spoke all of my thoughts out loud while I was programming.

Applied through an employee referral. Failed on a phone screening. The interviewer spoke extremely fast. In addition, there was a strong reverberation (looks like she spoke in a big room) on a line. As a result, I mostly guessed her questions. Even when I asked to repeat a question a few times she didn't change anything in her speech. I've had phone interviews before and they were good enough. But this one was a hell. Besides a few usual questions about previous experience and a reason for changing a job, there were only 2 technical questions, both about complexity of algorithms (O-notations), i.e. quite useless, in other words. I think I answered them correctly (Anyway it makes no sense to remember them). It took about 20 minutes. Overall, it was terrible experience. The worst thing, I failed it not due to lack of some technical skills but just because of communication issues. I have a lot of Java experience (they had open positions for that) and some other modern tools and technologies, as well as I'm opened for learning new technologies. But, unfortunately, I haven't had any chance to demonstrate it on any technical phone interviews. Never again.

When I was wondering where they got that email ID from I realized I had a Facebook dummy account with different name and that email ID associated with. It's creepy how the recruiter had that email address when Facebook assures us that recruiters are not given access to that kind of internal data. Anyway, I missed the interview because of this and when I contacted the recruiter, he said they had a different email address in their records and didn't schedule another one and never responded to my emails. Overall, in my opinion, they were very unprofessional and creepy.

I was contacted by Facebook recruiter. The entire process was efficient and quick. After the initial phone call with the recruiter, I received an email with details about interview process and how to prepare for technical interview in general, which I think it was pretty nice. I was scheduled for the phone interview one week after. The phone interview includes behavior questions and online coding and it took about 45 minutes. It started with typical introduction and then I was asked to talk about one of the works/projects listed on my resume and why I would pick to talk about that particular one. The interviewer didn't seem to impress about the project I picked to talk about. There were a couple of behavior questions (i.e. conflict resolution etc). Then the longest part of the phone interview was a coding question. You can pick any language you'd like, which is a plus. The coding question was not difficult, but clearly not an easy one, requires some thoughts. Be prepared to provide test cases. I had it working but not covering many edge cases. At the end, you can ask the interviewer any question, which I did. It sounded like the interviewer didn't seem to be excited about the current work, but kind enough to give me details about the challenging parts and current interesting problems the interviewer has been working on. I heard back the interview result from the recruiter exactly one week after.

I was referred to Facebook by a friend who works there and was contacted by a member of HR about a week later. We set up a date for a 45-minute technical phone interview which was to be held a week and a half later. For the actual interview, I was first asked a couple of generic questions about myself and Facebook before moving on to the technical questions. There were two programming questions. For the first question, I first described what my algorithm would be, then discussed time and space complexity before finally implementing it. My interviewer didn't have anything to say about my answer and we simply moved on. I took the same basic approach to the second question; described my algorithm, discussed space/time complexity, and then implemented it. However, after discussing the space and time complexity for my potential solution, my interviewer asked me if I saw any draw-backs to my algorithm. I told him that it used a lot of extra space, and he asked if I could think of a more efficient (space-wise) solution. I thought about it for awhile, but unfortunately blanked out. He then suggested I just go ahead and implement my algorithm. The last 5 or so minutes of the 45 minute interview were devoted to me asking questions. I asked a few, and the interview was over. I received a generic rejection email 3 days later.

I was contacted by a recruiter and asked the normal job / career stuff. An interviewer callef back and asked a lot of simple Linux networking questions that were pretty much to filter out people who didn't know what they were talking about. The questions were things like what port number various services were on and what simple Unix commands did. I then had a call scheduled with an engineer to do a test using a shared writing space. It was a very annoying tool to use and I had a bit of trouble using it because I'm an emacs guy and this was a very different In Bowser editor. Anyway, the problem was to recursively copy a directory structure to a remote file system using an api. My reviewer and I went through the solution I made and we confirmed it worked. I think I must have answered some performance optimization questions incorrectly because I didn't get a call back. He also asked me how I would extend it and I think I gave the wrong answer.

1. I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter on LinkedIn. 2. She arranged a coding phone screen. It was about an hour long, and assessed programming & algorithmic problem solving skills. 3. After I passed the phone screen, I was invited to an onsite interview, which was about 6 hours long. Each session lasted about 45 minutes. Five sessions involved programming questions on dynamic programming, data structures, system design, algorithmic complexity. One session was almost purely behavioral, even though I was applying for a software engineering position.

I was referred by a friend. Whole process took a week in a half - due to a pending deadline on my part. I had a phone interview and was then invited onsite at the end of the week. The onsite interview was composed of 3 interviews. They were typical questions of any other technical interview questions - although slightly more tree-heavy than other companies. On Monday I was contacted asking to provide references. I thought I had it in the bag because of this but Tuesday evening I was rejected. I know that they were strong and wouldn't cause my rejection. So I guess references are asked for before the onsite interviews are processed?

1 Behavior/Past experience 2 Ninja 3 Lunch (not rated) 4 Design 5 Ninja The behavior interview is about 1 hour, just talking about your past and current experience and projects you have done, plus a 15 mins coding test. first Ninja is an opening question, essentially creating your own question based on a scenario and do some coding. My experience was really good so you have the flexibility to design questions you are familiar with. Lunch was chat with a senior team lead, relax and get to know what you want to know. Design was easy for me, since I have done a similar system at my current job. the last ninja really sucked, the question is about a really unconventional event processing model using "pulling" instead of standard "push" model (like Storm), and the interviewer does not talk much and was not happy when I proposed the much simpler and intuitive push model. I failed on this one.

The second ninja (coding) test was about event processing system using pulling model, which literally no one in the industry is using.   5 Answers

Facebook came to my campus career fair where I turned in my resume. I had an onsite interview in New York which went well. It was completely a technical interview with only programming. I was asked 2 questions - the first was a simple reverse a signed integer, the second was a harder pattern matching problem that could be solved using a prefix tree. I was invited to a second on-site interview in Menlo Park. It was a long flight across the country and in hindsight totally not worth the time wasted - I skipped classes and turned in homework late as a result. The on-site was awful. My interviewer showed up late and then proceeded to ask me a very simple question about printing the paths to nodes in a binary tree. Coded it up with some minor corrections (since I was white boarding and you miss some stuff when you're face is glued to a wall). He then extended the question but cut me off because we ran out of time (this was completely his fault since he showed up a good 15 minutes late). They proceeded to give me a tour of the campus and talk with current engineers. It would have been fun if it hadn't been for the bad interview. Overall, I got the feeling that they're a large company and are definitely not as agile as they were a couple of years ago. Engineers were very complacent and talked more about their great perks than personal growth. In the end, I think I got caught in the interview anti-loop and had some poor luck. Promptly rejected. I really wish I hadn't wasted 48 hours flying for that sad excuse of an interview.

The pattern matching question in my 1st interview was reasonably tricky, but the interview did a fantastic job of giving me the right clues to help me solve it on my own.   Answer Question

Gave my resume at my university's tech fair and heard back two months later to schedule an interview. My interviewer was honestly pitiful. He was disinterested and rarely spoke (several times I thought the call got cut off). He didn't seem to care about me at all, but simply if I could answer the technical question. When given the chance to ask him questions about his experience he gave short answers that gave me a poor impression of Facebook as an employer: goal oriented (as in, finish or die trying), regimented, and not user-centric. The technical question was difficult as well, and I got the impression that asking questions of him was discouraged. I was stopped early, but I think I got the answer later after the interview was over (though I will never be sure as the spec was not 100% clear).

I had an on-campus interview with Facebook on my university campus, which was one-on-one and took about 45 minutes. I was given three binary search tree questions to answer in this first interview. A few weeks later, I had another interview on Facebook's campus in Menlo Park, and got to tour the whole place after with a group of other intern potentials. That second interview was also about 45 minutes, with a single question about sorting arrays efficiently. Some of the other intern interviewees had two questions, but I focused on solving the one problem well, and came up with a few solutions, I wrote out code in C++ for the most efficient one.

Met the recruiters at the university carer fair and got a call a week after that. Had my interview on campus within that week. Got back my results 2 weeks later. The overall process took less than 3 weeks. The interviewers are friendly and will give hints in between to keep you getting closer to solution. This was a 1 on 1 interview and coding had to done on white paper. The questions are straight forward but need to take into consideration all corner cases when giving your algorithm. Also the code needs to be clean, so think carefully before starting to just code. Also practice writing code on white paper as when you are doing it you tend to scratch out code in between and that reflects bad.

Question was find if one string is one edit distance away from the other string. This is the same as minimum edit distance question but with a twist. In this case you just want to know if its one edit away or not. The interviewer asked me if there was anything i could improve in the code, at that moment i did not think there could be any improvement other than some validation checks/readability of code.

I was hiring specifically for an iOS position. The recruiters start with Obj-C 5 multiple choice questions, which required some surprising depth. I won't get into specifics, but take time to understand memory management (even with arc), blocks, addresses and pointers. After was a phone interview which mostly involved a collaborative coding question. The questions asked here were very typical algorithmic questions, the answers usually involved a hash to cache meta values to increase performance. Protip: Be familiar with NSSet and NSOrderedSet. These data structures are more performant than NSArrays for some operations, and I found myself using them in almost every answer. Then you have an onsite visit, with 4 additional interviews: 2 coding, 1 design, and 1 "culture fit" which, for me, was really another coding interview. Your recruiter will contact during the next week or two afterwards to give you updates on your status. I believe there are three different meetings where your interviewing notes are reviewed and given consideration.

The first interview took place about five days after I was first contacted about the position; the interviewer asked a few questions about projects I'd done and then started with programming questions. The second interview happened a week later, and the interviewer dove straight into coding problems.

This was for a position in their Infrastructure team in Cambridge MA. Recruiter contacted me in September and was very interested in my background and experience with highly scalable systems - both in Finance and Mobile phone payments. I attended some small intimate presentations they did as they were initially opening a new Boston office and wanted to grow it out. The meetings were great and I learned a lot about how they solve some of their biggest problems. I then did a screening interview on-site (because I don't do technical screens well on the phone). The question was "Given a binary tree, write code to print the tree out line by line". I did OK and got the Breadth First Search down fine, but couldn't figure out the - line-by-line part. (Turns out this is Facebook's #1 question to ask in interviews). Although my performance wasn't great they gave me a break on that and asked me back for another screening interview. This time I prepared well for another coding interview but it turned out to be a Design interview. The problem was "Imagine you have 10,000 servers and need to monitor the performance of each one, how would you do it" - naturally you need to be able to NOT take too much of the bandwidth and so you'll have to do sampling, have some history to watch for trends etc. I passed that and was very excited to be flown out to Menlo Park for the final round. I studied like CRAZY based on questions on this site and CareerCup. I took 4 weeks and studied about 15 hours per week. Turns out I focused on the wrong questions - I studied Tree, String, Array and List algorithms based on the distribution of Q&A but I was asked Binary math and heap algorithms. Here are the questions I was asked. 1) How would you implement division without +, - or multiplication (a "classic" question, but not one of the ones I would focus on). I bombed on this as I was not expecting and could not recall my binary math. I figured out the high level outline but that was all. That I was asked this in the "culture fit" interview made this doubly unexpected. 2) Given 10,000 servers containing a Billion integers each how would you find how to find the median? I knew the answer to this question (use two heaps) - not because I had focused on it, but I had found it an interesting question while studying. However he then asked "How much memory do you need?" and I didn't know how big the heaps would need to be. The real answer I was trying to get is - what is the minimum heap you need. I had a guess but I think I got this wrong. 3) Given a List structure where each node contains a Next node and optionally a pointer to another list, flatten that list e.g. L1 --> L2 --> L3 --> L7 --> L8 | v L4 --> L5-->L6 WIll be flattened to L1 --> L2 --> L3 -->L4 -->L5-->L6-->L7-->L8 I did OK on this - getting the answer - but it appeared I took too long. The interviewer also interrupted me a lot while I was writing an initial solution and that threw me off - I like to be more iterative in my problem solving but I think he expected 100% immediate correctness. He had an observer there too and that guy looked bored out of his mind and that bugged me a little too as it wasn't clear who would be doing the judging. 4) I was also handed some hard to read Python code (I don't know Python) and asked to figure out what it does. I did OK on this - but again surprised to be handed hard-to-read code in a language I didn't know. 5) One final question "How would you implement the "ls" Unix function in your language of choice. It should take the input: >ls a/b/c/*/e/*/f/*/*/g and the output should be similar the the output given by unix." I used a tree structure to represent the file directory structure and wrote a solution from there. I did OK on this. Overall: Everyone seemed very nice - I had a nice lunch and the campus is interesting but it was clear that what I studied was not what I needed to (so lesson learned: don't just trust the distribution of questions on Glassdoor or CareerCup). I even got to walk past Zuckerberg's office (more of a conference room) and saw Sheryl Sandberg in there. One interesting thing I learned is a lot of Google people are leaving for Facebook. Also I'd say if you are over 30 (I am 41) you are a rare bird at Facebook :-) I knew based on the reactions of the interviewers that it was very probably a bust, but overall a good experience and something I will learn from. Very disappointing as I really wanted to be one of the first few Facebook engineers in the Boston area - and to work on their super high scalability issues but such is Life.

After that interviewer asked me to print a binary tree in level order. I did that. And then I was asked to print the tree in level order but using DFS. Interviewer was nice, was giving a lot of hints whenever I was stuck. Overall, a good experience.

Nothing difficult for someone who would be clear on data structures I guess.   Answer Question

Was contacted via email about a position that I would be a good fit for. I replied stating I was very interested and excited about the opportunity to work for Facebook However, I never received a follow up phone screen nor was I given a response to my email.

The interview questions were not extremely difficult, but I can tell they want people who understand the most basic concepts really well and can code clean and bug-free at once or after a little bit hints. The design questions were challenging though. Be prepared for that. The interview questions include two sum, reverse integer, edit distance, clone graph, etc.   Answer Question

A recruiter set up a short chat and ask some behaviour questions, and bad things happen. She ask me some cliche questions like "why facebook" and I give my answer by talking about the technology fb using, which she didn't understand. I guess she expect me to be a fan of social network but my topic is always technology. Finally she ask if I am talking with other company. I give her a name of a company. But she never heard that. Hey, that's a middle size company in bay area just ipo 2yrs ago. She just can't understand what I am talking in the phone call. Not even one. Got rejection few days later.

FB is very efficient in hiring. The HR first sent some regular questions for me to answer, including the time to start working and so on, and then arranged the phone interview directly.

A recruiter reached out to me, but I didn't start the phone screen until four weeks later as I wasn't fully prepared. After I passed the phone screen, I was invited to onsite interview the next day. I went to their office two weeks later. After three week I was told that I didn't pass as I didn't do well in the system design round. The recruiter said as I had three years experience, so the position was a senior position, so the system design interview was really critical.

I forgot some of the coding problems, but here are what I can remember. 1. move all 0s to the front of an integer array. 2. given a target and a sorted array, find the highest value smaller than the target. 3. given a 0-1 matrix, find the largest graph that is 1-connected. 4. design a system that can quickly return public accounts' activity data. For example, how many persons like/comment Taylor Swift's status. 5. In culture fit round, was asked many questions about how and why did you make this decision, what would you do in this case. For example, why did you apply for grad school? why not go to industry after undergrad? Why did you choose your current company three years ago? Why did you move to this state? If at that time you also got an offer from FB, what would you do? Why FB?   Answer Question

After uploading my resume and solving the puzzle I had requested, I got contacted by a recruiter through email. After two weeks, the recruiter interviewed me over the phone to learn about my interests. Then, in about two weeks, I had my phone interview. I was asked a question on comparing two general tree data structured. I answered the question and wrote the code correctly in the given space/time constraints. A week later I was contacted again and invited for on-site interview. However, the timing was not good and they said given my status (that I need an H1B), and current cap, they cannot move forward with the interview. The whole experience was smooth and exciting. I was just not quite lucky with the timeline.

Was contacted by a recruiter. Set up a phone interview; had weird telephone problems, couldn't understand my interviewer very well. Did some general algorithm questions in Python that were well-suited to a phone interview, but wasn't pleased with my performance overall. Recruiter contacted me back to do a second phone screen - said there "wasn't enough of a signal" the first time. Apparently this is not common. Second phone screen had problems with the collaborative edit software we used for coding - I had to stop, copy, and repaste my code several times for some reason. Again, the questions were well-suited to the format of the interview. Thought I did better but no better than an average performance, probably. No offer, the whole process took about a month (but I intentionally delayed the phone screen for personal reasons).

A 45 minutes phone interview as expected. They asked several questions about the background. Talk something about yourself, your project, your interests. And then moved forward to the code interview on Collabedit. The question is the simple 3 sum and pow(). At the end, they asked whether you have some questions about facebook.

Question is verbose, uses search engine, string matching etc., but at the end boils down to this: There is two dimensional array where each sub array (row) is sorted, i.e. [[1 1000 2000] [20 10001 5000] [55 10002 222222]] Find a minimum range contain a number from each row.

Regex matching function   Answer Question

Mar 7, 2014
---------------
Was contacted by recruiter in LinkedIn and started interview process. He was transparent, prompt and supporting during the process. He updated me every on every step and details and he was prompt: getting feedback after 3 hours from phone interview speaks for itself. Then I had on-site interview, three interviewer liked my answers, system design really like my design and thinking, but apparently one of the interviewer didn't like my coding style and I was asked to come for one more interview just to check the coding part again. So tip: use whiteboard better, apparently working and clean code is not enough it needs to look clean on board as well :) Overall process was positive. But, I had a feeling that some interviewers are really un-experienced and focus on wrong things. Also big difference from other companies: they expect you to be really fast (read - you need to know answer upfront). If you don't know answer upfront, but come up with solution after thinking, trying, making misatkes and optimizing - it doesn't count, at least it didn't in my case. Try to solve my problem below (if you don't know answer already), implement, test it on board in 15-20 minutes. Advice for FB: train your interviewers to focus on skills, NOT memorized skills. I have offer from big companies/competitors, so I will just go with them.

As for the interview itself, I was asked several general questions about my projects (nothing too special, really). The coding question is a standard regular expression matching one which you can find on LeetCode. Since I'm still doing my Master program, I haven't yet reached that far on LeetCode. I did solve the question in the end after the interviewer gave me some hint...But I don't think I did a very good job.   Answer Question

The interview process for me was uberly long. I wasn't planning on applying to Facebook, but a recruiter reached out to me mid-december on LinkedIn. I thought "what the heck, it's a great company" and got back to her the next day, but she was leaving for the XMas break. No more communication until early Jan. Connecting on the phone was a pain, as first she didn't call until 15 minutes after she said she would. I had stopped standing by the phone and went to email her when she did call, so missed it. We emailed and set something up for an hour later. This time she called 30 minutes late. No apologies or anything. Sigh. She advised that I put all of my other interviews before the Facebook one so that I could get practice, and then signed me up for a free interview review course they run. I went and things were all great, so I told them I was ready. Queue another 2 week pause while they tried to answer a question I had asked before scheduling me. When I finally made it onsite for an interview (mid-late feb), I had expected it to be a full day of interviewing, but instead it was a 30 minute screen before I could do the *actual* interview. In all fairness, I should have seen that coming. But anyways, did the screen and got a response before I had even left the parking that they wanted to schedule my full interview. I also got a call from my recruiter that afternoon to give me interview feedback. I thought that was awesome, as most people don't do that. I can't say how useful it was as I had no negative feedback from my interviewers and her advice was just "wow, keep doing whatever you just did!" but it sounds like it could be useful if things don't go perfectly the first time around. Anywho, by this time I had multiple other offers with deadlines on them. I went ahead and scheduled the final round interview for the following week, but ended up canceling the day before as I had decided to go with another company. This seemed to irk my recruiter, despite the fact that she was the one who told me to interview with other companies first and I had been upfront about that and the associated timelines during the whole process. When initial contact and end offer are 2.5 months apart, you can't expect someone to be sitting idle that whole time... The only reason I still rank this as a positive experience is because I had a secondary recruiter I worked with coordinating onsite logistics (the girl who first contacted me was out of state) and he was awesome. If any of you get the chance, work with Charlie. He's direct and super straight forward and knows that candidates are people with multiple options and treats you as such. I do a lot of mentoring and will certainly be sending any of my mentees who expresses interest in Fbook Charlie's way; he's a real gem.

One of the questions I got was around bit manipulation and built on itself by layers (i.e. how would you do x? ok, say you have a function for x, how would you do this new thing y?). The other question was a modification of a sorting question (i.e. the question itself was sort the array, but there were some parameters on the data type that made things extra fun/not standard sorting algorithm)   Answer Question

Overall the process is very fast and all the interviewers are very nice. It take 3 weeks to finish all the interviews (include christmas and new year holidays). I took 1 phone screen + 2 coding + 1 system design + 1 research interview( for PHD ). All the coding questions are the common questions you could meet them easily when you read " crack the coding interview" or surf GeeksforGeeks.com, and there was no brainteaser. The system design problem is kind of hard, because there are no right or wrong answers. I think I didn't perform that well in this round, because I am not very experienced in large system design. The research interview mainly focus on my research project, and we also had a small coding part, I did well on that. Honestly, I am kind of surprise that I did not get offer from Facebook, maybe there were some requirements that I did not match.

I was first contacted by a recruiter at Facebook. She told me that my background is very impressive and asked me if I would be interested in a software engineer position. I said that I would be excited and she scheduled the next round of interview with a Facebook engineer. It wasn't an on-site interview but a phone screening interview right before one. The engineer first asked me why I would want to work at Facebook. Then we moved on to two technical questions. The first one was merging two sorted arrays (both length n) in the most efficient way when the latter of the arrays have buffer size 2n. The second question was writing a function that checks if a tree is a binary search tree. For the second question, I got the right idea of using in-order traversal to check if it is a binary search but couldn't finish the implementation on time. After the interview, I wrote it on a editor myself and was sad to find out that it was not that complex at all. Anyway I am still waiting for a reply and I hope I could proceed to on-site interview. :)

Questions about recursion, css positioning, what would you like to do at Facebook, and closures.   Answer Question

(Front End Developer) After going to a conference, and talking with several people from Facebook who also attended, I was contacted via email to see if I was interested in doing an interview. I said yes, and got my first phone interview a few days later. In a shared code environment I needed to do a recursion assignment, and also create a polyfill. It went okay, although I wasn't happy with my performance on the polyfill. This took about 40 minutes. The more surprised I was that they asked me for a second phone interview, whereby I also had to do a recursion question. I made it harder then necessary for myself, which was unfortunate. After this I was invited to Facebook HQ, and had to do 4 interviews. Interviews were about recursion, closures, css, implementations. Unfortunately I wasn't good enough for Facebook, so that got me messed up for a month or so. I thought I did pretty good, but needed too much time to get going. The recruiters and interviewers were great. The process went really smooth, and comfortable.

Everyone was edgy when I started seeing people at Facebook, including the receptionists. Granted, job interviews tend to be critical, and we are the people who seemed to be begging for the highly-lucrative job positions. Then I saw this lady, who gave no self-introduction, no facial interaction, had only super-sharp look or pretended to be, who led me through these cold stairs, picked up a drink, and up to this tiny room, then started asking me questions. God bless her, turned out she was a software engineer, and may be the domain expert in my field. OK, so let's move on to programming, by which time I became edgy, too, knowing this lady sitting right behind me, feeling her freezing eyes examining up and down my neck, maybe my hair, too (I am a man). Did she notice my white hair as well? Anyway, the interview was quick (less than an hour), and I was let go. I knew there won't be any followup. Even if it does, am I willing to experience it again?

The FB recruiters were very on-the-ball and determined to get me to campus, and worked with me every step of the way. They flew me out, put me up in a nice hotel, and helped me know what to expect in the interviews. The process consisted of four interviews, broken up by lunch. Two "ninja" interviews (coding), one "jedi" interview (personality and values), and one systems design interview (whose cool name I forgot). The questions were tough, but fair. They definitely have a preference for code questions that combine data structures and creative thinking. My only complaint about the process was that they would spend a little too much time prior to starting the coding question asking me about my OS knowledge (I interviewed for a mobile job), and that left me pressed for time (sometimes) on the actual whiteboard coding.

I was contacted by a recruiter for the security team through email about a few openings on the security team. I said, I would like to know more. After a number of email exchanges to set up a time, another recruiter emailed me and told me someone would call me at the scheduled time. The first recruiter mentioned that I will be using the tool on collabedit.com. So far, I was not told what position I was actually interviewing for or whether I was setting up a time for a general interview or whether they were giving me more details! I did apply to a few different roles on their site so I wasn't sure what was up. Turns out first phone call was with hiring manager and I was getting interviewed for a software engineer position. Hiring manager asked if I was told what positions were available and I said no and he was glad to explain for me. I told the manager I was hoping for a security engineering job, not software engineering. He told me I might be a better fit for a different team and he will tell the other manager I was interested and I will hear from him. I asked if there was a opening on that team and he said they are always hiring new talent. I took that as a good sign. I didn't actually get asked to code during the phone interview. I followed up with the recruiters asking where to proceed and whether I could interview with the manager on the other team and they said they will get back to me. I waited and got no emails setting up another interview. I asked what's going on and have not heard back. It's been 10 days. I guess I have been dropped? I am disappointed at the lack of communication and lack of detail from the recruiters. I guess this is common with big companies.

I had never heard of any questions that I was asked (in all the 4 rounds of interviews). So pretty much all the problem required me to think on the fly.   1 Answer

Had asked my friend to refer, within a week was contacted by recruiter and was asked for dates for telephonic screen. Provided my date preference, and within 2 days the phone screen was scheduled. Got result of phone screen next day, and was invited to Facebook HQ for a day long interview. Facebook has University Day, where they call people and conduct their interviews, also on the same day they have campus tour with tech talk. But, as I had other offer deadline, they were pretty comfortable in scheduling "one-off" interview for me, and was called on non-university day just for the interviews. Interview process was awesome. Had total of 4 rounds (1 Behavioral and 3 technical). Also after first round, I was accompanied by Facebook Engineer for lunch, and he walked me over the campus. I loved the campus and the interaction with the engineer. He almost answered all my questions and further gave me reasons about why working at Facebook was awesome. Post lunch, had 3 back to back technical interviews. All the interviewers were smart, provided enough information about the problem and also left grey areas for me to ask and figure out. For all the questions, implementation was expected. Most of the time during my interviews, I was standing and writing/discussing code on the white board. Overall the day was hectic but it is indeed great fun as I got pretty interesting problems to solve and discuss. After the interviews, I got my result after a week. Summarize: Fast and Fair Process. Great experience.

signed NDA so cannot discuss. But do prepare for sorting, pattern matching algorithms, design problems such as how to go about implementing certain features in Facebook, and review previous work experience for some stuff to talk about in depth during behavioral interview.   Answer Question

Received message via LinkedIn for an interview, shortly after replying a quick phone call was set up to determine what my interests were and how it aligns with the work available at Facebook. After that, a phone interview is done to screen candidates, the phone interview involves actual coding done using a shared online notepad. Then an in person interview is done which consists of 4 interviews (algorithms - system design - class design/algorithms - behavioral). There is also a break where you can ask an engineer any questions regarding the company. Results come back in a week after the in person interview.

I think the most difficult part were not the coding question itself but that they were the kind of questions where you have to be recall a lot from basic computer science classes. Things you tend to forget if you have already been working for a couple of years. But then again, that was not necessarily unexpected.   1 Answer

I uploaded my CV in their system and got contacted by a recruiter. In the initial phone screen we discussed my interests and strength and the recruiter got back to me about a group that sounded like a good fit. Since I was local I did the first technical interview directly on site. It took about 45min. My interviewer was not directly associated with the group that I talked about with the recruiter. But he did take my background into account when asking questions. It went pretty well and a couple of days later, they invited me back for a full day of interviews. The full day interviews were mostly general coding questions and one architecture session. Although this time, I was talking directly to the people from the group were I saw a fit with my background and interests, unfortunately the interviewers did not ask any related questions. They kept strictly to (I guess) Facebook approved coding questions. Those were very low level and I did only perform moderately well I think. The architecture session went much better and was almost related to my background. After the full day of interviews it was pretty clear that this was not a good fit. They confirmed that a couple of days later and the interview process stopped there.

Recruiter contacted on LinkedIn. Set up phone screen for a few days later, which consisted of basic behavioral questions and some technical questions (basically questions passed to the recruiters by engineering to weed out super weak candidates). Then a technical phone screen with an engineer. First a basic coding question. Second question was a weird one. It was basically a language specific question related to how to modify the default behavior of a certain class. I spent the rest and a long portion of the interview trying to understand what exactly needed to be done and couldn't come up with a solution at all. Then I asked the interviewer how what he was asking could be achieved and he told me about a similar class that would provide that capability. Since I had no idea about that class (and there's really no reason for anyone to know it off top of their heads), I wasted a lot of time trying to solve something that I could have never solved. This was akin to a trick question and obviously very flawed to ask to a software engineer to assess any analytical skills whatsoever. Then chit chatted with the engineer about Facebook but it was obvious that neither side wanted to engage in anymore conversation. Got a rejection email from the recruiter I believe a couple days later.

The processes started with a very quick phone screening that went over my interests, why I wanted to work for Facebook, etc, which was followed up by one or two phone interviews in which I was asked to enter code into a browser and answer a few technical questions. They also asked a few questions about my resume. I took a flight to their on-site interview which included a gorgeous hotel and generous compensation for food, etc. The on-site interview was a few hours but it flew by. Some interviewers seemed experienced and others seemed like they didn't know what they were doing in the interview room. Everyone I interacted with (from phone screening to the actual interviews) seemed very organized and the entire interview process was extremely smooth. I greatly appreciated their coordination and team effort.

Most difficult questions were around systems design since the question was extremely broad, in which I was supposed to write/draw on a white board for 30-45 minutes explaining what the concept was about. Another unexpected question involved the trie data structure, it wasn't too hard, but I've never heard of it.   Answer Question

I had interviewed for a number of positions (full time and intern) before, and was never successful until this, my final chance. Luckily, things went in my favor and I was offered a full-time position. My recruiter was quick and very responsive over email. I already had an offer with another company at the time, and thus, my recruiter was able to expedite me through the already quick interview process. I had one coding challenge to be turned in whenever it was completed, a non-technical interview over the phone, and two on-site interviews. My first on-site interview was an interview with my recruiter plus a technical interview. My second on-site was a series of four technical interviews. All in all, I was very pleased with the sincerity and speed my recruiter put in and of course, being given an offer made was the cherry on top :).

Expect typical software engineering coding questions on the more difficult side of the spectrum. Nothing easy like "reverse this array", but don't be afraid to ask questions during the interview and thinking out loud is encouraged.   Answer Question

I'm a Master student at a top CS grad school. I was doing an internship in Bay area in August and I started my process just two weeks before my last day there. Therefore the whole process was pretty fast because they (and I) want to finish all interviews before I leave so that I don't need to fly all the way from the east coast. My friend helped me submit my resume. A few days later the recruiter contacted me via Email to schedule an initial HR interview. In this HR interview he told me great things about facebook and asked for my related experiences and why I would like to join facebook. He looks satisfied with my background and we moved forward to schedule a technical phone screen. The phone screen went OK. I managed to code the first question in an efficient way but failed to figure out any possible way to solve its upgraded version with more constraints. I received an email from the recruiter two days after the phone screen and was told I passed it. We scheduled an on-site interview in the same week. The onsite interview consisted of three tech interviews. Two of them focused on pure coding/algorithm questions. One of them focused on behavioral questions and a easier coding question. I did well in one pure coding and the mixed one. I did OK in the last coding one: did not finish writing my code but the major part is clear and correct. I did make some minor mistakes and corrected them after the interviewer pointed it out. Four days after my on-site interview, the recruiter asked me for two references. Two days later I received the offer.

Application was via an internal referral from a friend who used to work at a start-up I was at. He put me in their system and around 4 days later, a recruiter called for first contact. The recruiter was quick to assess what I have done and decide to bring me straight in for a 1h30 min interview the next week. In this session I got a quick "hi" from the recruiter and then two 30 min slots, one on architecture and design (so called pirate interview) and the other on coding (ninja). Of the 2, I stormed the coding question but met with an interviewer in the pirate side that had tailored a question from his previous experience in the area I had recently worked in and it didn't work out (mostly as I knew more about the topic and the interviewer wanted to talk about a specific trick he knew). Still, I got called back the next week for a full day. Lunch, more coding, culture interviews etc... Coding and design were knockouts again, the softer skills were less successful. I think the key here is that you need to present a confident, well rehearsed personality with answers for the usual questions (biggest mistake etc...). DO NOT talk about mistakes and then admit you don't know the root cause for them, even if they were true mysteries. Pick another example!!! The process took ~4 weeks, the end dragging out by 2 weeks as it seems they could not decide if it was a hire or not. I had multiple offers by this time and had to take one that was expiring and too good to miss. Later I found that there was no hire decision and felt ok about it - I would probably think about going back at some point, but with a stronger prep in the softer skill Q+A side.

Got referred through a friend at FB. They contacted me 1-2 weeks later via email. Set up a phone chat that the recruiter initially missed, but we rescheduled. Once we had a phone conversation she said they can move really fast: ~1 week to make an offer. I went on site for a first round interview (since I'm local to the area). The interviewer was nice. She asked me to describe what I work on now. Then we jumped into two coding problems. I interpreted the problem as a Hamming Distance problem and asked if it was, she kind of shrugged it off -- I don't think she knew what Hamming Distance meant. I coded a solution on a laptop (new trial process they were doing), but it turned out we were not talking about the same problem. In retrospect, the problem she was describing was Levenshtein Distance. I had the feeling she only knew the solution to the problem because she had the answer sheet. The second problem was another classic DP problem. Finding the sum of 1's in a submatrix. I went on to describe the recurring relation for the subproblem in the linear case. She didn't want me to do that and she quickly said the solution to the 2D case was a generalization of the 1D case. Because of the novelty of the laptop in the interview and the misunderstanding of the initial problem, the recruiter fought for me to do another phone screen even though the first one didn't go that well. The second interview I opted for a phone interview. This time the interviewer seemed more knowledgable and came into FB through an acquisition. I was asked what I work on now and some hard problem I solved in the past. Again two interview questions were asked (using collabedit). The first was to list out all the paths in a binary tree which was simple. I did make some mistakes and corrected it in the code as we talked through use cases. The second problem was checking if a string was a palindrome for strings with symbols and spaces in them which again is easy. I did solve both problems, but in the beginning the interviewer stated he's looking for accuracy and performance. My tree traversal was a simple preorder traversal using recursion and the palindrome involved one loop. Apparently the second interview did not go well even though I provided correct solutions in both. I guess the interviewer was serious when he said he's looking for correctness -- I guess you need to be able to code compilable/error-free code in a text editor. The recruiter and onsite coordinator were very helpful and the interviewers were very friendly. However, the style of FB interviews seems to be that you should study and know by heart common interview puzzles/algorithms/DP problems and be able to reproduce that error free.

Contacted by recruiter, set up phone interview. Spoke with interviewer and was asked to implement Fibonacci sequence. Knowing that there are several methods of implementing it based on what is important (space, runtime) and what the goal is (for N > large values there's a constant time solution) Interviewer was unable to answer questions on the use and instead just told me to "just write something". I proceeded to implement the algorithm three ways. I asked a friend there if he knew the interviewer, found out later that the interviewer was reading off a script and that's why he couldn't explain the requirements better. Several weeks later was told they decided not to continue forward.

I came onsite for what was described as an hour-long introductory and technical interview. I was greeted by the recruiter and shown around the office (FB NYC), then we chatted for 10-15 minutes. Then an engineer came in and we started the technical part of the interview, which took 45+ minutes (we ran over). First he asked me about Hadoop, since I mentioned that I used it at my current job. I used hadoop for machine learning tasks, so we discussed the details of the system. The rest of the interview was coding on a whiteboard. The questions got progressively more difficult. The first was: Given two string representations of binary numbers (e.g. "1001", "10") write a function that adds them and returns the result as a string as well (e.g. "1011"). The next had several parts: (a) first, write a function to calculate the hamming distance between two binary numbers (b) write a function that takes a list of binary numbers and returns the sum of the hamming distances for each pair (c) the answer I gave for b was O(n^2), I was then tasked with finding a more efficient solution. I struggled mightily, and was eventually helped to the solution by many hints from the interviewer. After that, I had a chance to ask questions of the interviewer, and then we were done. I don't know if I've made it to the next round or not.

I was contacted by a recruiter about a possible position. While I was not immediately looking, I was intrigued enough to continue with the process. I had a quick phone call with my recruiter to go over my background and experience. She concluded the phone call by determining my availability for a technical phone screen and followed up with some research materials to better prepare for the phone screen. The technical phone screen was set up using collabedit as the platform for sharing code between myself and the interviewer. I was asked a few simple technical questions, and a few harder programming problems dealing with algorithms and data structures. The interviewer was patient and helpful. The recruiter emailed me the same evening to let me know that I would not be moving further in the process, as my initial hesitations on the early data structure questions signalled poor understanding of basic concepts.

I was contacted on 25 February via LinkedIn following a recommendation. The position was in the Mobile Operations team. It was followed by a series of phone interviews: - one with the technical sourcer - one with the head of the team - two more with some specialists in various departments Following the phone interviews, was an onsite interview in Menlo Park on 22 April. Given the 10 hrs time zone difference, they were sympathetic with the jet lag and flew me there on Saturday for the Monday interviews. The interview day had five sessions: - one with the head of the team - one with guys from the team (codding session) - one with a guy from management - two more with guys from other departments (systems and networking) With the exception of codding interview, where a second guy was there to observe, all other interviews were 1:1 I flew out on Tuesday, and on Thursday I received a call that they were happy with my performance and we can move forward.

I expected a tirade of technical questions. The unexpected part was that the interview was both ways: they interviewed me, I interviewed them. Most parts were more like brainstorming session than exams. The most difficult question was when a guy showed me a gdb stack trace of the threads within a process which hung. It was an facebook internal application, so I had no previous knowledge of that application. The question was what went wrong.

An internal recruiter contacted me out of the blue by Linkedin and email. We scheduled a phone call. Talked about my experience and education and then about available positions at Facebook. He then invited me to come onsite for a short screening interview first. I requested a couple of weeks to prepare for the interview. He was perfectly ok with that and even sent me some links to preparation materials. Instead of a phone screen, I had a short 1:1 interview for 45 minutes onsite. Mostly coding on whiteboard and a little time set aside for questions about the company. A week after that, four 1:1 interviews. Two coding interviews. One "manager" interview: mostly talking about past projects and future ambitions. One system design interview - you basically have to describe how you would design a given system without going into too much detail. Received a call from recruiter next day. He said that I will have to come for one more interview. So a week after I had another series of two interviews, one coding and one manager. I received an offer two days after the last interview. During the whole process, the company was very flexible about scheduling interviews. Everything happens really fast if you want it, or you can take your time to prepare. Recruiter was very nice and supportive, as were people at FB in general. Some interviewers did not talk much and some were more willing to discuss, but all were very polite. Coding questions involve basic data structures like trees, combinatorial problems and sometimes a relatively simple dynamic programming problem. They are not too hard but you have to do them quickly and explain everything clearly. Understanding of Big-O is a must!

I applied online through Linkedin and got an email from a FB recruiter asking whether we can arrange sometime to talk on phone. We then had a quick talk on phone about what I was doing, what I had done related to software development, and how was an interview process with FB. Then he said he will arrange a phone interview for me. The first phone interviewer was nice and I can answer the question easily although I did not understand the question correctly. But he was very patient explaining it to me and I finally did it right. After a week I received an email from the recruiter saying that the response to the first interview was positive and they wanted to schedule another phone interview. The second phone interview was a week later with a Chinese girl who did not sound friendly or enthusiastic but with a cold voice. I felt that she did not like me and would not want me to be in FB since the beginning of the interview. This made me very nervous and confused, and I lost my confidence. Hence, even though the question was quite simple but I did not do it well. I can guess what happen next: I got a "thanks from FB" the day after.

The questions are easy and common, but I was very disappointed with the second phone interviewer. The first interviewer was very nice and supportive. The first question was to return the value of a roman number given in a string. The question for the second phone interview was to print out the paths to all leaves of a binary tree.   3 Answers

I was contacted by the recruiter who found me via graph search, and was asked whether I was job hunting. I chose to go onsite for the initial phone screen. The question was straightforward with emphasis on fast and accurate coding, and the interviewer was very knowledgeable. A few days after the screen the recruiter scheduled an on-site with me, and the dates were quite flexible. The on-site consisted of four interviews, 3 pure coding (of which one is about design) and 1 research interview (I guess this is for all PhD applicants). I was quite happy with the coding ones but the research one was, well, a little annoying since the interviewer seemed to be dismissive to everything. But overall, it was a nice experience, two interviews plus lunch + tour around plus two in the afternoon, and it was done! I did wait for 3 weeks till the decision was make, and during the period the HR seems to be a little nonresponsive. When I followed up what I received was something like a one line email saying "we are reviewing your case and will come back to you soon". This was a little annoying especially the feeling of being silently rejected started to grow, but I guess it is not the HR's fault anyway. In the end I was offered a job with flexible titles - software engineer or research scientist or whatever. I decided not to take the offer in the end, but the interview process was very smooth.

Signed NDA, so maybe it's not OK to disclose the questions... It was standard coding questions, not those hard ones at leetcode, but you need to make sure not to make silly mistakes. Missing a few semicolons is file, though.   Answer Question

Had an HR phone call that was mostly basic questions about previous experience, and why I feel I would be a good fit at Facebook. At the end of the call, we set up an on-site technical interview. Had to postpone it a while, but they were very helpful with rescheduling whenever was convenient for me. The technical interview went well, getting a tour of the facility before sitting down with an engineer. The interview lasted around an hour. I was asked a question about checking for palindromes, and a question about graph traversal. Ran into some trouble with the graph traversal, which I eventually described to the interviewer correctly, but didn't have enough time to write it on the whiteboard. I think that's the reason I was told to get more experience and reapply in a few months.

Phone: 3 rounds On-site: several rounds Culture: profession Problems are neither hard nor tricky. The biggest challenge is Offensive Chinese Interviewer. If they show disregard of your question about the interview problem, don't be frustrated, keep asking what you want to know. If you give up asking, you may lose some important information that you should check with them at first. And when they are picky about your code, or when they indicate that there are bugs in your code, check it carefully, fix as much as you can. And then try to let them discuss the remaining bugs, even if you can't find any more, and no matter how dictatorial they are. Don't end up arguing with them on whether it's really a bug.

1- Try to solve interview question as much as you can. 2- You may not be able to answer the question 100% correct. Don't worry, try to explain you thinking process. 3- Talk with your interviewer like you potential team-mate in future. It would help you to communicate efficiently.   Answer Question

It is always good not to stuck at some point. I got my first interview from TopCoder, that was a in person interview, one algorithm question in 3 different difficulty levels. I waited for 2 months to get my second interview, it was a 45-min phone interview, 2 algorithm questions. It took about 30 mins to finish the coding phase, then I asked some questions about FB culture and backend engineering team. Then the Christmas came, I got feedback of 2nd interview in early January, which is positive, so they decided to flew me to Menlo Park for onsite interview. The process was quick, they pay for the flight and hotel. There were 5 rounds of onsite interviews: - 2 coding interviews, both were testing how quick and accurate interviewee can solve the problem. Problem is not very difficult, some can be found at glassdoor here. - 1 backend system design, interview asked me to explain one of the backend systems I designed. During the interview, he raised a lot of questions about the system, mostly about scalability, reliability and performance. - 1 client side system design, asked to design a client side component. - 1 half-behavior and half-coding interview It was pleasant experience to interview with Facebook:-)

Had brief phone conversation with interviewer initially, who scheduled a technical interview with an engineer working at Facebook HQ. The second technical interview was fairly relaxed, I was asked to solve two problems using collabedit.com, firstly, finding all the anagrams in an array of strings, secondly, finding the number of ways a given score could be reached for a game with 3 different ways of scoring (e.g. 3, 5 and 10 points). After the phone interview I was offered an onsite interview in at Menlo Park (travel expenses paid for). The interview day involved 4 back to back interviews with different engineers. The questions varied in complexity and required answers to be given on a white board. Those I can remember was implementing combinations(n, k), printing a binary tree L-R, and implementing a comparator function to sort files based on a certain naming convention. I found it difficult to make any personal connections with my interviewers, they all seemed rushed and uninterested in striking up conversation - it was not an enjoyable experience. Indeed, my first interviewer was clearly more interested in what he was working on as he arrived ~20minutes late.

Providing an algorithm for combinations(n, k), not because of it's complexity, just because it took my the majority of the interview to understand that this was the problem I was solving - it was not made very clear at all.   3 Answers

I was cold-called by a recruiter and offered a technical interview. I scheduled the interview, but in the meantime, I received an offer from another company, and canceled the interview. Later, I decided to re-apply for the same position and the process continued where it was left. I was interviewed by phone and asked to complete a coding assignment. As I discovered later, this assignment appears here as one of the questions. Later, I was notified I passed the phone screening and was invited for an on-site interview. There was a total of 4 interviews, including three coding interviews. Even though most of the questions appeared on this site, I did not do very well in the coding part, thus, as expected, did not receive the offer. Throughout the entire process, the hiring staff was extremely helpful and provided lots of information regarding the position, and the interviewing process itself. The recruiter also organized a phone call with on of the engineers to help me learn more about the position I was applying for.

I had one phone interview, before I was invited to on-site interview on their new office in Menlo Park. They paid for all the expenses incurred during the trip (hotel, transportation, food, and any other non-personal expenses) The on-site event lasted from 9 am to 4 pm. It started with a breakfast on one of their micro kitchen located on every floor of their building, and soon after the breakfast every candidate was taken to a room where they took three 45-minutes interview with Facebook engineers. One was behavioral, and 2 were technical. In a behavioral interview, interviewer will look at your resume and ask you couple of questions related to it, so make sure you are able to talk about whatever you put on your resume. Two technical interview is mainly coding on a whiteboard. They will ask some basic question like "why did you choose Facebook" at the very beginning, but the majority of your time there will be spent coding on a whiteboard. After the interviews, candidates are taken to a lunch on one of the cafeteria on their campus. I really loved the food there, and they have lot of different choices (Italian, Chinese, grills, ...). After lunch there was 45-minute tour around the Facebook campus. The event concluded with two tech talks (one backend and one frontend) and Q&A session Overall it was a great experience.

Within 2 weeks I was informed that I was approved for an onsite interview in Palo Alto HQ. There I had 4 consecutive interviews (Ninja, Pirate, Jedi, Ninja). Ninja interviews require coding in board practice - quite difficult since if you answer correctly in one of them they ask something else. Jedi was related to my PhD.

The process was fast and challenging. Phone interview, then remote technical interview with live coding through a web code share site. After passing those rounds I was invited to onsite interview in Menlo Park. The onsite interview involved 4 different people, with a lunch break. I am in my mid 30's in age, and I must say I felt like the old guy at the club. My interviewers were all younger than me, and had a palpable air of superiority. I felt like I nailed each of the interviews, but was not extended an offer with "You struggled on one of the interviews" as the only explanation. Its hard for me shake the thought that it was more work culture than work skill that prevented me from receiving an offer. All in all, no complaints. It was a fun and challenging experience and I ended up with a better job in the long run.

Got a mail from a recruiter asking me if I am interested. Then he scheduled a coding interview on Skype. They instructed me before this interview to go over all of the CS basics. I did the interview, was OK, and then I was invited to an on-site interviews day. Although I live outside of the US they had no problem flying me over, they paid for all expenses and arranged this whole thing in one week(!!). At the campus I had 4 interviews: 1 X design "high level" interview. 1 X manager interview, we talked a lot about the product(s), company's culture and my background. (And a short coding questions in the end) 2 X white board coding interviews. After the first two interviews I had lunch with this extremely nice recruiter and she also gave me a tour in the campus which was really cool. Couple of days after the on-site day I was contacted and they told me that they need to interview me some more because there was a miss match within the feedbacks I got. We set up another session of two consecutive Skype coding interviews which were really good and after couple of days I was informed that they want to send me an offer ;-) Total 7 interviews. 5 of them were coding. TIPS: * Get extremely comfortable with CS undergrad material: classic algorithms, data structures, sorting, string manipulations(!!), lists, trees, basic linear algebra, working with large data sets. Don't only read about these topics - make sure you can code it, fast and accurate!! In the Skype/Phone interviews they asked me to write the code in http://collabedit.com. [I am not allowed to disclose the specific questions... sorry] * If you are reading this review then you are on the right track - I practiced only by answering questions which were posted on this site. I first tried to solve them alone, when stuck I checked the answers section and on StackOverflow. * Make sure you are well familiar with this company and its product. It will come up in every interview and especially in the manager interview. Be ready to give great answers on "Why facebook?" - I think all 7 interviewers asked me this question and it's really important to them. * For non US residents - Make sure you arrive to the bay area couple of days before so you'll be able to rest and beat the jet-leg. I've arrived 24 hours before, couldn't sleep because of the excitement and jet-leg, I think that being really tired (especially after lunch) affected my performances. BOTTOM LINE - Challenging for a position at FB is huge and you have to invest a lot of time and effort into it. At least that was the case for me, I studied real hard and almost didn't make it.

After I solved a puzzle through InterviewStreet.com, a recruiter contacted me by e-mail and we set up an introductory phone call (15 min). She seemed really nice, she asked me to evaluate my knowledge on several technologies and sublects like C++, Perl, Algorithms/Data Structures, .NET Framework etc. She immediately told me that she was going to schedule a technical interview with an engineer. The engineer called me several days later and asked me to solve together an algorithmic problem via a workspace sharing website. We could both write code simultaneously and see each other's work. The question wasn't hard and although I had a pretty good idea how to solve the task, I wasn't very smooth and made several mistakes. Maybe because it was my first technical interview ever. Bottom line, I liked their attitude and they did a good job. It was my fault that I didn't go to a second interview and I've learnt my lessons. It was a very good experience.

I had a great feeling of solid communication with recruiters. The recruiters kept me accurately informed about interview progress. In order to establish an appropriate level of compensation, they seek information about my current employment without being invasive. I have felt interview process can be described by integrity and maturity, making Facebook a great place to work. This is in stark difference with my experience I have interviewing for other companies (namely Google) where after I passed the technical interviews, the recruiters pushed for very detailed compensation information, even though they in the end failed to provide an offer, missing deadlines in communication causing me to miss a competitive exploding offer.

Initial communication was through a recruiter, who reached out unprompted via LinkedIn. After chatting with the recruiter briefly over the phone, she quickly set me up for a phone interview, which was not that difficult/unexpected. This was followed by a half-day on-site interview, which involved lunch followed by meeting with four separate employees four 45-60 minutes each. Interviews were back-to-back, and the last interviewer escorted me back to the lobby.

The initial question (writing a function to calculate a square root) ended up being the most difficult because it threw me off. I knew there was a good iterative method for doing so, but could not recall Newton's method in the moment, and I sadly let this nagging thought get in the way of my ability to work through the problem. My failure to perform well on that question set a negative tone for the rest of the interview, since each interviewer after the first can see notes from the previous interviewers.   9 Answers

First step is one or two phone screens, then a half-day or more of on-site interviews. Focus is on programming and architecture talent, but they're also looking for a good cultural fit. An important thing is that you may be interviewed targeted for a specific function, or for general engineering qualifications. In any case, after boojtcamp, you will be shopped around to all the groups that are looking for people, and you get to call your shot, so you don't have to have your specific career path chosen before you apply.

The recruiter called up and asked me if I was interested in the job opportunity. The process began with solving a programming problem on InterviewStreet for which I was given 90 minutes to solve. This was followed by a 60 minute telephonic interview. After clearing these two rounds, I was invited onsite and I had to go through 3 face-to-face interviews. The problems were hard algorithmic problems and you are expected to write clean code in the first go. The interviewers were really friendly and helpful. My advice would be that you have confidence in yourself and be as honest in an interview as possible. For practice, you should be well versed with standard algorithmic techniques like dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, solving linear recurrences in logarithmic time, recursion, tree traversals, etc.

You are given an integer N and an integer M. You are supposed to write a method void findBestCoinsThatMinimizeAverage(int N, int M) that prints the best collection of N coins that minimize the average number of minimum coins needed to generate values from 1 to M. So, if M = 100, and N = 4, then if we use the set {1, 5, 10, 25} to generate each value from 1 to 100, so that for each value the number of coins are minimized, i.e. 1 = 1 (1 coin), 2 = 1 + 1 (2 coins),..., 6 = 1 + 5 (2 coins), ..., 24 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (8 coins), and we take the average of these coins, we would see that the average comes out to ~5.7. But if we instead use {1, 5, 18, 25}, the average would come out to be 3.7. We are to find that set of N coins, and print them, that produce the minimum average.   8 Answers

First round interview at the facebook seattle office. The question was related to string parsing : basically given a set of key value pairs in some format, to print them according to another format. I did not understand the specifications clearly and probably should have spent more time doing that. Instead, I went through many iterations with the interviewer pointing out specific mistakes each time. My advice : the question may be very different from what you think it probably is, so spend enough time making sure you get it. Also, in case of this problem, it was algorithmically very simple, but you are bound to miss some cases and make certain mistakes. So, when you see a simple problem, try to look at the problem and your solution carefully for possible gotchas.

Got the interview referred by an employee. The interview process was very impersonal, with canned e-mail responses and literally no connection between the recruiter and the applicant. The recruiter persistently ignored my questions regarding team assignments. Had only one interview, with the "collaborative" coding question asked within the first 15 seconds of picking up the phone. Poor English skills of the interviewer and unwillingness to provide any hints were extremely unexpected. Despite providing the complete theoretical solution to the problem, the interviewer toyed with me not finding a small mistake in the code. After "deciding to move forward with other candidates" the recruiter declined to provide any feedback on the application. Undeniably it's a great place to work, but the recruiting process left a bad taste in my mouth.

A recruiter contacted me after a mutual friend gave them my resume. They were aware that I had a pending offer that I had to make a decision on, and were very good about moving the process along as quickly as possible. I lived nearby, so I did two on-site interviews initially. After completely bombing one of them but doing well on the other I was brought in a little bit later for the full interview. I had about 5 people interview me. Afterwards they were still unsure so I had a couple phone interviews/conversations. The recruiter did a great job of keeping me up-to-date about what was happening, was very honest with me, and was able to rush to get me an offer (which was especially nice because it was almost Christmas at the time)

Was referred by an employee and then contacted by an HR. Had 3 rounds of phone interviews and then was called for onsite interviews. The questions were aimed at testing coding and design skills. They are looking for people who can write the correct code at the first go.

The level of questions was not as difficult as Google.

Since I had some industry experience, after my phone screens, I had the full onsite interview loop. All interviews involve some coding, but they vary in how much: - 2 ninja (coding) interviews. These are garden-variety programming interviews and can be prepped pretty much the same way you'd prep for Google or any other major software company. - 1 jedi (engineering fit) interview. The jedi is designed to assess whether you'll thrive in Facebook's engineering team. You'll talk about problems you've worked through in the past, engineering decisions you've made, and so forth. You'll likely do some coding, too. - 1 pirate (engineering design) interview. If you're in the product-engineering bucket, you'll probably be asked to design a user-facing product; the interview will range from actual coding to high-level design considerations. New-grad hires (people without significant industry experience) will generally not have pirates.

The phone interview was brief and mechanical. The interviewer seemed clearly unprepared, inexperienced, and uninterested, as if it was an unwanted interruption to their day. The interviewer had no knowledge of my previous conversations with the company or why exactly he was interviewing me. I was clearly passed his way expressly for the purpose of evaluating my technical ability. The interviewer asked two coding questions, using an online collaborative editor to view my progress. After the problem was sufficiently answered, the interviewer quickly ended the conversation. As it has been described to me, Facebook has "streamlined" the hiring process in order to be able to evaluate candidates very quickly. From my experience, this came off as unorganized and unprofessional. My final impression was that the interviewer did not thoroughly evaluated me as a candidate, but sufficed that I could answer 2 standard interview questions quickly and with explanation. Compared to other companies I interviewed with during the same period, this interview was not rigorous enough to really determine quality.

My resume was submitted by an employee. I got a call from recruiter next day, she was nice and explained me the process, then scheduled me for phone interview within same week. She was nice enough to provide some interview tips, so I had chance to review some topics. I think fb recruiters are totally on your side. The phone interviewer was a very nice guy, he was definitely not a recent graduate like some other poster complained, he talked about the pre-internet boom days, so I think he has least 15 years experience. The phone screen took 45 mins. First 10-15 mins, he asked about my background and why it's a good match for the position, why I want to work in FB. Then I was asked to coding question to "find minimum depth of a binary search tree". It was not a hard question, any average coder could do it within 15 mins. I wrote the code with no hint or help from him. During the coding, he was mostly quite, at one point, he pointed out a possible bug which I fixed instantly. At the end, I was trying to optimize the code, he said the code would work, no need to optimize it further. Then he let me ask questions about FB about 15 mins. After the interview, I compiled the code and it really worked, didn't even have a single compile error. Next day, I received a rejection letter from the recruiter with no details. So trick is, writing the code is not enough, but your code must be very close the most optimized version known and you should be able to write 'close to perfect' code in minimum time. I googled for similar algorithms and found out my solution was well above the average, but not the best one. I guess they expect you to write something very close to best available code possible can be written, so they single out best coders. So 'move fast, break things'..

First I had a phone interview. The question was fairly straight-forward (multiply two very large numbers given as Strings) and the interviewer wasn't looking for any tricks or anything like that to solve. Like others have mentioned, quick clean code seems to be the key. Unfortunately, the interviewer had a very thick East Asian accent and talking over the phone just made things worse. I had to ask him to repeat quite a few times. It was probably me but at times I couldn't even tell when he'd asked a question because of the inflection! It must've gone well enough though because I got an on-site call. The on-site was two interviews of 45 min each. In the first one, I took a bit of a hit because a) I couldn't see the solution right away b) it took me a while to get up to speed and code the thing - I did manage to finish it though and it seemed (relatively) bug-free. Again, as lots of people have mentioned, the interviewer seemed quite young, just a year or so out of school and he didn't offer much in terms of feedback - positive or negative - as the interview progressed. Once he'd given me the question and given me the hint that got me started, he was busy with his iPhone, rarely looking up. That kinda sucked. The second interviewer was much nicer - probably one of the best ones I've interviewed with - lots of feedback, lots of encouragement, was accepting of different trains of thought and non-standard answers. Seemed like a really nice guy too. Overall, it seems to be the case with Facebook that a) Your interview really depends on who you get b) They seem to value quick-clean-bug free-optimized code at the first try more than anything else c) Questions are of average to above-average difficulty (if you've prepared!)

The rumours about the hiring process being haphazard are true. First a manager phone screened me and asked me to come to Palo Alto. Next the recruiter told me I stll need to go through a phone screen. If the disconnect stopped there it would have been OK. I did not expect to get invited to Palo Alto without a tech screen. Here's the kicker. I am a senior engineer in my present job. The person who phone screened me was a fresh college hire and had spent about 1 month working at facebook. Facebook was that person's first job. I am not saying a new hire cannot be smarter than a senior person, but it is reasonable to think that it would be a good practice at a big company to allow new hires especially fresh out of school to settle down, understand the needs of the company and then start interviewing people.

I had on campus interviews in the spring and then decided to interview for full time in the fall. I had three interviews - the first went very well, the second was terrible, the third was alright. The terrible interviewer asked some basic technical questions involving writing code on the board. As I thought out loud, I asked the interviewer clarification questions and then ultimately asked whether I should start writing code on the board. The interviewer either did not respond to my questions or mumbled off a few incomprehensible words. I started writing code and as soon as I stepped back from the board, the interviewer pointed out my mistake without giving me a chance to assess the code myself. He did this an another two times for the subsequent questions. Overall, the questions were not difficult at all. It seems that Facebook wants to make sure that you code frequently enough that you do not make any errors on your first hack at a problem. This seems to fit the "go fast and break things" motto. Although things didn't work out for me, I got an offer from Google, so I guess that's not a bad second choice.

The HR is very fast in turnaround, though the final decision is kind of be kept back for a while, but if you ask they will let you know. Anyway, this is the first company I got interview so maybe it is just too difficult for a rookie interviewee.

I was referred to Facebook by a friend and the hiring recruiter emailed me the next day. He asked for the resume saying that he will send it over to the hiring manager. Next day, the recruiter asked for the convenient days and time to call, and called me the following day. He explained the hiring process, asked me about myself and what I did/do. Then, a week later, I had technical phone interview with a FB employee. We had a session in Google Docs set up. She first asked me about myself a little and asked one technical question. I had to write C/C++ code in Google Docs while explaining what I do on the phone. It was quite hard actually. Not even the question itself but the whole experience, you feel bad if you make a typo (and i did many silly typos that I usually do not make when writing code), because she can see your typing in real time. Also, you cannot debug or anything.. In the end, to understand my idea of a solution, she gave me an example input and asked to traverse it using my code. After getting an idea she said, ok, almost correct, you could find a bug in 10 mins, ya, but we gotta end now. Next day the original recruiter emailed me saying that they wouldn't take me. It seems they needed the correct solution and code to be done on the fly in 25 mins.

Was originally contact by a recruiter over LinkedIn. I had a phone interview, followed by a visit to a Facebook recruiting event where I met with an engineer in-person, followed by another phone screen, followed by an on-site in Palo Alto with 4 members of the engineering staff. The whole process seemed somewhat disorganized, I was informed after my recruiting event visit that I would be getting an on-site as the next step, but was informed a couple of days later that I'd have to do another phone screen first. The questions in the screens and the onsite seemed reasonable enough. I'll admit to having somewhat of an off-day at the on-site. I completely fumbled the "are there any bugs in your code" question with at least one of the interviewers; I said there wasn't, but there was a pretty obvious bug once he described the failure mode to me. There was a scheduling mix-up with at least one of my interviewers, which caused my time with him to be cut short. I'm sure that didn't help with him getting a good feel for me for the sake of his interview feedback. The culture seems a bit more corporatey than the recruiting buzz might put forward; it seems geared toward people who want to have one foot in the startup pond while having the other firmly planted on the dry land of large, relatively safe organization. There are a lot of small teams, and the reflection I got is that there is a non-negligible amount of bureaucracy weighing on the organization. I guess when you get to 1000 people, that will happen. The office space is a mostly open floor plan, and the gear the developers are provided to work on is really good stuff. But that's an initial impression, and things are not always as they appear. So yeah, weirdness in the interview scheduling and such dragged down my impression, but I'd probably give the dice another roll if the chance comes up again. If nothing else, it will allow me a second glimpse to either bolster or contradict my first impressions.

Every single interview was exactly the same format: the interviewer gives me two or three programming problems and asked me to solve them in my language of choice in front of him on a whiteboard (or virtual whiteboard). No behavioral interview, and the only contact I had with the HR chicks was "OMG you should work here."

I was contacted via email by HR saying that my friend had recommended I be interviewed for a spot at the company. I was pretty surprised by this, but have found that this is how Facebook often goes about doing things. We scheduled an interview for a few days later, which I thought was going to be a technical interview. When I got on the phone with the interview he asked me about what I've been working on recently, and so I got into this whole thing about my research project which I probably took a good 10 - 15 minutes describing. He basically just verbally nodded through the whole thing. He then asked me about what positions I was interested in interviewing for at Facebook. In my push to prepare for what I was expecting to be a technical interview, I somehow neglected to actually figure out what specifically I could work on at Facebook. I mentioned doing something with the large data sets they work on, since my research focused somewhat loosely on large-scale data analysis. Should have prepped for that one, but no problem. He then told me that he'd be happy to set me up for a phone interview with an engineer as soon as possible and I was like "whaa?! I thought you were one!". Not actually, but I did say that I'd be happy to interview with an engineer and so he got that set up for me. I'll come back and post once I've had my *actual* technical interview (instead of just an HR sanity check)

facebook is an unprofessional company to interview with. The first phone interviewer only wanted some insider information regarding my company (which I didn't give to him). The second interviewer could not get the interviewing tool working! He wasted 1/2 hour of my time before calling and telling me he would like to reschedule. So I patiently rescheduled with HR for the next day. The 2nd interviewer now calls 20 minutes late. Is fairly rude and capricious. Says that he is in a hurry. Did not explain his problem correctly. When I explained my solution, quickly tacked on some additional requirements and then said my solution did not work. The interview only lasted about 15 minutes. Said that he worked on consistency problems at facebook. Everybody knows how horrible the facebook newsfeed consistency is. Total time wasted with these people = 4hours (over two weeks, not including recruiter time). Compensation offered for my time; none. Conclusion: run as fast as you can from this company.

I applied online through the Facebook website and heard back from HR within 2 weeks. After speaking with the recruiter, we setup a phone interview with one of the engineers. The phone interview was about 20 minutes long and consisted of 2 questions which were algorithmic in nature, one of which was reversing a linked list. I heard back from them about a week later and we setup a time for an on-site interview. I was alotted $1000USD for travel expenses to travel from Toronto, ON to Palo Alto, CA. The on-site interview lasted 4 hours and was split up into 1 hour interviews with a different engineer. The questions were mostly abstract, and language independent. Content of the questions varied from riddles to database design. My impression of the first three engineers was good, they seemed like nice guys, and knowledgeable. The last interviewer came off as pretentious, I felt as though he wanted me to fail -- just my opinion! Overall, the office culture seemed relaxed and the problems they are solving there are interesting ones. I'd recommend interviewing with them if only for the chance to visit Palo Alto!

The interviewer briefly introduced himself in terms of when he has joined the company and what project he has (lately) worked on. Then I was required to solve a coding task. I'd say the task was rather simple, and what the interviewer was looking for was: -- ability to quickly grasp the task at hand -- ability to quickly come up with idea how to (efficiently enough) solve it -- ability to quickly and correctly turn your idea into working code. Suggestion: once you're done coding -- go through your code, check how it will handle the corner cases, reason out loud about what you're doing. Don't panic :) Than, at the end you are given the opportunity to ask questions. As you can expect, they'd like to see you show genuine interest in how things are done there, so showing some excitement helps a lot.

Here's my opinion from my experience interviewing at Facebook. They tell you the process in advance. One phone interview, 5 in house interviews (3 coding, 1 design and 1 behavioural). All interviews are 45 minutes each and one-on-one, and you have to write code in all of the coding interviews, and possibly in the design one too. In the first round, one person decides whether you get through or not. In the 5 rounds, each interviewer provides their feedback after you have finished the interviews which means that if you do badly in one then the other interviewers won't actually know. Be fully aware, and make no mistake about this - there is an incredibly high possibility that you will get rejected. That sounds harsh but consider it from their position - huge numbers of people apply, huge numbers get interviewed, and they have to pick people out somehow. They also say that they prefer to avoid hiring the wrong person so ultimately they end up inadvertantly rejecting good candidates incase they turn out to be a bad hire, so the risk of getting rejecting is even higher. Basically, this means you are most likely going to be wasting a ridiculous amount of your time and effort. Perhaps because of this, they are incredibly nice and friendly. This really was the nicest and most pleasant interview I have had. Also, once you understand the scenario, it really helps to kill your nerves if you suffer from that. After all, why stress about something you have practically no chance of succeeding in? Negative, true, but the odds are really stacked against you and you would do well to understand that and just be yourself. The questions are not that hard, I found. In fact, I solved the first one so quickly I even surprised myself. You do have to write on the whiteboard, but that of course means that there can not be much code to write since a whiteboard is not that big. Indeed the questions are not that hard really. I felt that they do expect you to talk about what you are doing but also to get it right very quickly and without any mistakes. They want to see how you approach the problem etc., but get real - they don't want to see you fumbling around, they want to see that you know the answer and can bang it out. Ultimately, even if you know the answer to the technical questions and you get them right you will still likely fail over something you can't really control or even know about. In my case, they said I didn't have management experience, but you know what, I didn't apply for a manager role and they never even asked about management or leadership at all. I was pretty annoyed to be honest, it felt like a complete waste of my time and I felt like an idiot for worrying so much about the interviews. They do provide you with some preparation links which are useful. There is also a book called Cracking The Coding Interview. It doesn't have their questions in it of course, but it gives you plenty of examples on how to solve these kinds of questions so if you read up on it you should be able to bang them out quite easily. Overall, it is worth going just to see if you can handle it because you probably can! Just make sure that you feel good about what you achieved even if they say no.

Make sure you can tell them what YOU actually did in your previous projects, not what the project was. Know how to traverse data structures. Know what the time/space complexity is. Seriously, it really isn't that hard but you do need to know it so well that you can literally write it flawlessly. They want to see that you arrive at the decision to use a tree/hashtable/graph whatever, but then they expect you to bang out that solution.   Answer Question

No different to others mentioned here: contacted via LinkedIn, one screening call (45mins), then on-site with 4 x 45mins interviews. Overall, the algorithm questions are not particularly hard. I have interviewed with FB twice, and both times felt the sessions went well (although considerably better the second time), but no offer either time. You won't get detailed enough feedback to know where you might have tripped up, if anywhere, though. From their point of view, I think this is understandable, but makes it harder to deal with the rejection; if you had fouled up every session you would feel better than if you basically answered all the questions, with seemingly positive feedback from each interviewer, yet not got an offer... As noted elsewhere, it's probably best to be stoic about the whole thing and accept that they have so many candidates they probably apply a "benefit of the doubt" policy that works against in their favour; ie. I would imagine they employ a sort of "thumb up", "thumb down" policy. They are, however, very pleasant and expect to have a positive experience of the process even if the result is not what you might want yourself.

The process starts out with contacting a recruiter. I was fortunate to have a friend who had previous interned at Facebook. From there, if they like the looks of your application, you will be given an online screening test on the hackerrank platform - 90 minutes.

I was given a phone interview, however did not perform well.

I was referred by an existing employee. After an initial email by a recruiter, I didn't hear back for two weeks. I dropped a chaser and the managed to get the interview process started. I did a total of two phone screens with them. The first one went quite well and I heard back from the recruiter within a day. However I didn't manage to get past the second phone screen. Each phone screen is pretty much standard, the interviewer calls you on your mobile or Skype, and provide you with a collabedit or codeshare page to type out code in real-time. The recruitment process is slick and systematic generally.

The interview process for the internship position consisted of two phone interviews. The first interview was more about my past experience and had a single programming question. During the interview you're supposed to code the solution in a language of your choice. The interviewer will see what you're coding as you type and make mistakes. By doing so they have insights on how you approach programming problems. The second interview had two programming questions with similar degree of difficulty.

The first problem was the classical "reverse a linked list" problem. It's easy, but may make you feel nervous as getting the pointer manipulation right may be tricky.   1 Answer

I competed in a Kaggle competition conducted by Facebook. A few weeks after the competition ended I was contacted by a recruiter and asked a few basic questions via email. About a week after that the recruiter told me I was going to be interviewed. He also included a bunch of URLs to read so I would be familiar with the Facebook interview style. The interview was setup by a coordinator. Two days later the interview took place over the phone. The interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself by discussing my favorite project. He said my resume was too extensive to discuss. I worked in Silicon Valley for 5 years and have a significant background in software engineering. There was no discussion of the Kaggle competition. He then presented a puzzle. It involved a grid with the letters X, O, and G. X were walls, O were rooms, and G were guards. I had to create an algorithm that computed the the shortest path to each room from a guard. So if it took a guard 3 steps to reach a room, and another guard 2 steps, then you would only keep the 2. The grid was variable size (N x N). The task was to design the algorithm and then code it up in a shared web page. I had about 35 minutes to complete the puzzle. I wasn't able to get it completed. The next day I thought about it while eating lunch and the best way to solve it became clear. I was definitely on the right track during the interview, but it was simply incomplete. The puzzle itself wasn't amazingly hard. It's just the time constraints. I needed another 20 minutes or so to get it done right. A few days later I was told my background was not what they were looking for. This was a really strange thing to say because my background was never discussed. There is no doubt in my mind that my background is strong enough to work at facebook. As a matter of fact, after seeing the skills of the interviewing engineer (I looked him up on LinkedIn), I feel I'm over qualified. A few observations... This was the first time I've been interviewed by someone with significantly less experience than myself. Your past experience is irrelevant. I could have helped Steve Jobs invent the iphone but if you can't solve the puzzle then you'll be passed over. While I was working on the puzzle the interviewer gave me a "tip". It turns out that the tip was incorrect. I'm 100% positive that using an efficient solution is completely incompatible with the tip he gave me. Maybe it was part of the test. If you're good at puzzles and have a solid understand of software development, but not a lot of experience, then you should go apply. My personal impression is that they're looking for younger less experienced people. My interviewer started out as an intern so that seems to be a good alternative if you're still in college.

The recruiter started the contact, we schedule an interview. In general in this first one I was asked about my experience, what I've worked with, the recruiter presented FB and all the cool stuff that we are used to hear about it. The she asked 2 easy techinical: 1 - What's a linked list, how it looks like, how do you implement it, in what it differs from an array and to explicity a use case that I would pick a list instead of an array. 2 - She picks a number between 0-1000 and wants to know what would I do to guess it (binary search). In the techinical interview I was asked to develop, in 45 minutes, an algorithm able to print a tree level by level, each level in one line. I did it successfully. The only problem is that when I was about to test it, the interviewer just interrupted and said that something was wrong instead of just let me do it, I fix it, then it happened again. After finish the algorithm he asked me about time and memory consumption of the algorithm which I also calculated correclty. After the test he opened to questions, so he shared a lot about fb's culture, projects, carreer, etc.

I got a chance of phone interview with Facebook through Interviewstreet about a year and a half ago and failed quickly, mostly because I'm not a native English speaker and I am really bad at speaking English. I keep practicing English after that, then I got another chance 2 months ago, recommended by a friend interning at Facebook. The recruiter return to me very quickly, in less than a week, but I'm very busy and not well prepared at that time, so I did the phone interview a month later. I was asked to solve an easy coding problem, I finished it very quickly but made a small mistake in analyzing the complexity. I only found that mistake after the interview. The interviewer is very experienced, I have a great time talking to him after the coding phrase. Then I got a chance to onsite. I had 3 interviews. 2 interviewers asked coding problems and 1 asked coding problems and also talked about my projects in resume. The problems are harder than the problem in phone interview. I really struggled at 1 of them. But I think I did a good job at another ones. The interviewer who talking with me about my projects is from a strong background and seems a little tough, I must say I was very nervous when talking to him, but luckily it turned out well. In overall, the recruiters and the interviewers are all very nice. I am not familiar with the process of interviewing with companies in U.S and asked so many questions, the recruiters replied very quickly.

After I had the technical one, they really say that you must be prepared. I did not believe that it was difficult, actually I did answer it correctly, I believe that what is trick it`s the way that you answer or how fast your get it how god it`s your code, answering it correct it`s not enough. After this I waited for a week for the answer, unfortunately I did not receive a job offer or my process continue.

Submitted resume online. I think it said there were so many people who apply that I could a multi-hour programming challenge online and if it was successful I'd get a phone screen call. Reviewing the sample problem, it might have been an NP-Hard problem or at least one that would require several hundred lines of mind-breaking code. I program all day for a living and even off hours for other projects. Resumes should qualify one for a phone screen. I submitted just that and got a canned rejection email a couple days later, presumably for not doing the quiz.

Reviewing the sample problem, it might have been an NP-Hard problem or at least one that would require several hundred lines of mind-breaking code. I program all day for a living and even off hours for other projects. Resumes should qualify one for a phone screen. I submitted just that and got a canned rejection email a couple days later, presumably for not doing the quiz. A couple weeks later I was contacted by a FB recruiter. We spoke approximate 30 minutes and emphasis was placed on how fun a place it is to work. They do a single 45-minute in person technical interview, and if that goes well they do 4, 45-min technical interviews in a single visit. The single 45-min session started with about 3 minutes of initial talk about my resume and what I work on now. I don't get the sense they cared at all about experience or what I was or have worked on. After that charade was done, we jumped right to the whiteboard. Two programming questions were asked. The first was an array reordering one that was almost trivially easy but I worked through it cleanly. He seemed quite happy with that. The second was significantly harder than the first, a complex array algorithm. I worked my way through it on the board but my solution was non-ideal in time complexity after analysis. He suggested we rework it. While I was able to and understood the logic, I relied on his feedback a bit much to come to the final solution in the last minutes. Got rejection email the next morning from recruiter. Apparently others in their interview pool for the position had got a more optimal answer faster.

I was contacted by a recruiting agency for software engineering position at Facebook, and after I told them I was willing to apply, my resume was forwarded to Facebook's recruiter. Next day, I got an email from the FB recruiter with a link to an online coding test on interviewstreet. This test was for one hour duration, designed to test coding skills of the interviewer. It was a string parsing problem and code could be written in any language and we'd just need to submit the output on a given input set. I got an email later from the Facebook people that I passed that test and would need to do a phone interview. My phone interview was scheduled in a week. An engineer called me up for the phone interview and asked about my work projects. I explained to him briefly and also got to know a little about his work at Facebook. He then followed onto the technical interviewing part and posed a problem for me. We were working on a shared document for this part. This was a problem about the classic binary search tree data structure, like an RB Tree. I coded a simple solution and I was asked to analyse its runtime complexity. I analysed the complexity and was able to put it in Big O notation. He was satisfied with that solution and then moved onto talking about his work, what Facebook is expecting from the candidates and such. The conversation quickly ended after that . A couple weeks later, their recruiter informed me that I passed the phone interview and would be scheduled personal interviews. About a month after my phone interview, it was the day for the personal interviews and I was flown into their interviewing location. I had two technical interviews that day and another general, informal get-to-know-you-and-your-work type of interview. For technical interviews, code was to be written on a whiteboard. In one of the technical interviews, I was told to come up with an algorithm for a variation of the classic knapsack problem. This could be solved with a dynamic programming and I coded the same on the whiteboard. It's important to explain how the solution was arrived at. After coding it up, I was asked to analyse its complexity. I'd written a recursive solution and I could only write a recurrence relation for the complexity function, not a closed form. I also told him that an interative solution is also possible and wrote it out too. Being an iterative code, with a simple nested loop, it was also easy to analyse its complexity. The interviewer was actually ok with the recurrence relation for the complexity and didn't bug me on an exact form. He seemed satisfied with my solution and then we moved onto general topics. Interview was quickly over after that. For the second technical interview, I was asked a problem on balanced binary search trees. I'd previously implemented an RB Tree and that experience helped me very much for this interview. Without this experience, I couldn't have solved that problem and would've been rejected. I was asked the classic interview problem on sorted-but-rotated array. I knew the solution for this one and it involved binary search. I wrote the solution for this one and the interview was quickly over after that. I was told to provide 3 personal references on that day and left for home. About 2 weeks later, I was informed that there would be another technical interview. In this interview, I was asked to implement a simple regex parser. Conceptually, some what simpler than the other interviews, but getting the implementation correct was tricky for this one. I got it right and he was satisfied with the code. I was also then asked about the runtime complexity for the solution. I left the interview confidently. A week later, I was offered the job. Generally speaking, good programming skills help a lot in getting this job. On top of that, I'd suggest reading the CS algorithms textbook by Cormen. Writing good code, with a clear understanding of its complexity is a must.

Hey I got contact with a recruiter, then we talked about 30 minutes. One week after I had one phone interview. He asked me two coding questions and he also wanted me to prove mathematically why my solution is right. I did the coding problems and I prove what he wanted. After a week, they invite me for onsite interview. There were 4 interview. The first was more about my research and only one coding question. The last one was high level design question and the other two were just coding. I did pretty good, and I just made one silly mistake for implementing one problem. I figured it out after 10 min, but I had the feeling that the interviewer does not like it. That was the coding question at the end of the first interview. I think that killed me and I didn't get any offer.

Facebook came to our campus and I was pre-selected for an interview for their summer internships. They told me that it was going to be a 45 minutes long interview. The interviewer demonstrated very odd social skills, contrary to the fact that he worked for the major social networking company. Interviewer didn't even introduce himself, or look at my resume or ask how I am going. They instantly put me on the white board and asked me to write some code. I politely asked him whether he even looked at my resume. He mentioned that he didn't look at it, and he rather want me to focus on writing code on the board. At that point, I was a bit ticked off. So, I told him that I didn't want to work for a company where people are treated as coders, and not humans. Then, I just walked out on him. The entire experience lasted for 5 minutes. When I emailed the HR person expressing my disappointment, she defended the interviewer by saying that they were interviewing a lot of people and that's why they didn't have time to chit-chat with the interviewees.

But the first interviewer started phone interview around 10 minutes late [in the end ending up kicked out of conf. room] and asked two very simple questions. One of the questions was given 2 arrays of size n and 2n containing n elements only, both sorted in ascending order, How will you merge, first array with second [which has size 2n] into second array in ascending order. I just used merge sort merge step and wrote java like psuedo code in collabedit. I tried out my code later and it worked fine with no changes [except that I used .length() instead of .length for array length]. But he didn't provide any feedback on what he was looking for. It was correct and complexity was the best possible. One thing I can think of later was I didn't add any method level comments [although I had comments in body] as it was pseudo code. Maybe he was looking for it [pure guess - as I don't know what he wanted]. I left with impression of having done the interview very well [I have worked in the best of companies and got interviewed and interview for those companies] and most of the time you know when you blew it. But I was surprised to get the rejection, 2 days later! Particularly given that question was too easy! Now I am left pondering over what was it? I consider interviews where the perception of interviewer and interviewee differs wildly in terms of performance as bad interviews with negative experience associated with it, as the interviewer didn't communicate his intention with the interviewee properly. If he was not looking for correctness and perf. [objectively defined as mentioned above], What was it?

I submitted my resume through my school. I was then contacted by a recruiter who scheduled a phone interview. The phone interview went well and they flew me out to their headquarters. I paid for travel and the hotel stay (as well as food) but was reimbursed a few weeks later. The one on one interview consisted of some behavioral questions but mainly problem solving.

I got my resume submitted through an existing employer at Facebook. Was first contacted by a recruiter who called me up and had a half hour talk with me discussing why I wanted to join Facebook, and surprisingly also started asking me data structures and C++ basics like friend functions, complexity of searching and sorting etc (though she assured me that this was not an interview and only an informal chat). I got all her questions correct, though I donot know if that made any difference. I followed up with her sending her an email regarding scheduling an interview and then she wrote back gconfirming a phone interview slot. It was a phone screen with a Software Engineer at Facebook, and I was asked to code in Collabedit, a web interface in which both I and he could write and see the code.

The interviewer was very friendly, and we chatted some after he introduced himself and his projects. He asked me to design and implement algorithms that correct typos, offering guidance, encouragement, and confirmation along the way. It felt really good to voice my thoughts along the way, and it helped him to know what I'm thinking. He asked a few follow-up questions afterwords about my code (which I think he made up on the spot). I answered and we agreed on the answers. Next, he presented a scenario that we formed a web startup featuring that code at its core. So then we discussed how to use more memory and less CPU, and how to scale up the company. At the end I asked him his thought about fb and what he did before working there. The experience was very fun.

I was first called by a FB recruiter and we chatted about 15 min about my general background information. I then was followed up with a phone interview with a FB engineer. He seems to be an experienced engineer. He started with a common background question like challenge of current project. Then, he asked me to design the Facebook Credit system. I proceeded with talking about I would started with designing the backend of the system, for example a ER diagram that would outline the relationship between existing user information and the new information related to the FB Credit system. I was a little nervous at the beginning, but the interviewer jumped in and gave me some help. He then asked me how would the total credit points of a user be calculated based on my design. For that question, I answered how the data is delivered to user from end to end in a multi-tiered web application. Next is the programing question (write a function to convert an ASCII representation of a positive integer to it's numeric value). I had a subtle bug in my code, but in general I got it right. I coded in PHP, the interviewer is satisfied with it since FB uses lots of PHP. The last 5 min was for me to ask him some questions. The interviewer was very professional and helpful during the interview. He was able to follow my thoughts and provide hints.

I was contacted by the Facebook recruiter saying I need to solve one of the puzzle from the Facebook puzzles to start the interview process. I had solved one problem and then recruiter scheduled my phone interview. The interview was good. The guy at the other end was nice and smart. The interview last for around 1 hr. It start by asking me about myself. He asked me about my choice between three platforms (linux kernel, MySql, JAVA script). I had chosen Mysql and he asked me why did I choose MySql. Other questions are described below. I got response from the recruiter that they would like to keep me on hold, as they are finding difficulty in judging with large number of candidates. I answered all questions correctly (I feel) except my written code (took around 10 to 15 mins) for the problem had one bug which he had noticed correctly and told me to resolve it. After resolving it he gave me the green signal. One of the big problem (I guess one of the main factor in the interview) I faced that as I am OK with English, I was finding difficulty in understanding his accent. So many times the interviewer had to repeat his questions. Lastly he asked me if I have any questions for them. I asked one question. This is how end my phone interview with Facebook.

An HR contacted me and said I should complete one of their three hardest puzzles. The puzzle was interesting, but the fact that I spent 2.5 days to do that (1 day was spent on submitting it in a correct way so that the puzzle robot accepts it), and it won't help when interviewing anywhere else, annoyed me. I then had a phone interview. The guy was very clever, which was nice. The questions were: what is the most exciting project you had, and white a function to multiply two arbitrarily large integers. I spent quite a while writing a recursive solution for the problem, made some mistakes during that, but fixed those purely by myself. The interviewer did not provide any feedback during the process when I described my "way of thinking" and the programming, so I even had to ask whether he was on the line. With phone interview, not feedback is a bit too harsh, imho. Then I was asked to write an iterative solution, and I completed it as well. I did not write the solutions easily, and my way of explaining was not perfectly clear and great, but I solved what I was asked. Then the HR contacted me saying they won't consider me anymore this year. I politely asked for feedback, but got the answer that there is nothing to share. Quite surprising for a social-oriented company.

I was referred by an employee and was contacted by a hr recruiter, who scheduled a phone interview with me. From reading online I was expecting a basic screen with questions like why do I want to work at Facebook, and what I do currently. I wasn't expecting any technical questions at this stage but she did throw a basic search question, which flustered me a bit, and after a few minutes of me talking it out but not giving the exact right answer, she said she would get back to me with next steps which would either be to complete one of the puzzles on the website or to schedule phone interviews with an engineer. Promptly the next day she responded that I needed to do at least one of the puzzles and that there was no time limit, but the faster I completed it, the faster I could move on. I'm currently working on one of the puzzles.

A technical recruiter set up a call with me. She asked about my research projects which she can't care less about. Then she asked what programming languages I am most comfortable with and some specifics about the language. I was also asked about the runtime complexity of binary search and the average num of guesses it takes to find a number between 1 to 1000. Overall it's pretty simple since this is just the first screening. The next interview will involve writing code in real time to solve a question asked by an engineering on the phone.

She then asked what language I programmed best and resumed to ask about 10 trivial questions about the language. (ex. What is the difference between Java's Array and Vector classes). She seemed to have trouble even reading the questions so it was clearly someone who did not know the answers either. I was directed to attempt one of their online challenges and respond to her when completed.
