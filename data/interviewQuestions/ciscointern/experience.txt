I applied for an engineering intern position through the online application system. Received an interview. The interview surprisingly had no technical questions and focused mainly on my past work experience. At one point, however, my interviewer made me very uncomfortable by suggesting that if I got the position, it would be because I am female instead of my existing computer science qualifications.

Started at recruiting even on campus. After learning of the internship I applied online. Around a month passed before I received an email in regards to the internship. I was then contacted by somebody in HR to set up an interview through webex. The first round interview lasted thirty minutes, and was with an NCE. A lot of the questions were personality based, and asking what my goals were. A few technical questions were thrown in at the end. Overall a good experience, Cisco seems like a great company to work for. I am scheduled for the next round of interviews, I will try to update.

I interviewed for two positions: one in software engineering and one in IT engineering. I applied for both interviews on the school job website and after the deadline they emailed me about a week later requesting time slots to sign up to interview at. I interviewed with a software engineering professional first from the local area on campus. She gave me entirely behavioral questions with absolutely no technical questions which was very surprising. She asked me questions: Where would you like to work after graduation? What programming languages do you know and what classes have you taken? What do you think is the most interesting thing about technology? What do you know about Cisco? She also asked me a lot about the stuff I had on my resume and almost every single job experience I had on there as well. She asked about clubs too. The IT Engineering interview consisted of a webex interview because the interviewer had to rush home in the middle of the day. She asked more scenario questions and some testing questions as well on products. The first round interviews were pretty short and consisted of less than 30 minutes each. After a couple weeks when I got a counter offer I emailed Cisco and they sped up the second round interview and had me fill in a background check. The second round interview for the IT engineering position was also webex and the questions were more about the projects that I had done outside of class and what I knew about data and engineering. They got back to me a couple business days after that because I had a conflicting deadline.

The entire interview process was pretty easy and straightforward with mainly behavioral questions. Just remember to have a good explanation and demonstration of extracurriculars and projects.   Answer Question

Phone interview, then on campus interview. It took them 2 months from this point to give me a onsite interview. This was a ridiculous amount of time. I accepted another offer because of the lack of timeliness. The interviewer when I did interview seemed very out of it. It seemed as if she was filling in for someone because she was very all over the place. Also, the room we were in was very cramped. Not inviting what so ever. Not a good impression to make.

Recruiting at my local university. Met with the division manager that was hiring. Accepted my resume. Called me to schedule an interview on location. Once arrived was interviewed by 3 people individually, all engineers i'd be working with. First person asked me general questions about my past projects in electrical engineering and past internship experiences and how that helped me or what I learned. next one asked me about metastability and also about past projects. Last one asked me about c++ coding structures and how I would design a loop to go over an array of some sort. I can't remember too well. He also asked about Design verification generalities as to how I would check for errors on a basic calculator that was giving a wrong answer. Was thrown off by the simplicity of it but if you think about it he was looking at how I would go about the process, he didn't expect me to really know how to fix a simple calculator. He was trying to see how my thought process was in design verification mostly. Interesting interview process to say the least. It wasn't difficult but it wasn't the easiest either.

As a computer science major after my sophomore year, I was looking for an internship. Someone mentioned Cisco and I sent an email to them along with my resume. I was Interviewed jointly by two software engineers over the phone. Was asked about my experience with networking and what I knew about networking. I was asked about my coursework at my university and what language(s) I preferred. I was given a few scenarios where a network was behaving weird and was asked what steps I would take to figure out the cause of the problem and how I would fix it. Since the engineers worked primarily with test automation, the questions were centered around trying to figure my methodology in finding out the cause of problems and rectifying them. They were satisfied with my responses and my overall approach to problem solving. I was scheduled to interview with the hiring manager the next day or two. I couple days later the manager that I would be working for gave me a call to get a better idea about me and current knowledge base. It was a more relaxed interview, mostly to see if I was personable and easy to get along with, and if I would be a good fit for his team. That went well also. My recruiter sent me an email within the next couple days informing me that they were extending an offer to work for them over the summer as a software engineering intern. Overall a great first-time experience.

I applied through the university's career website, and was interviewed on campus. The interview was 30 minutes long, and it was mainly him trying to find out my personality. He didn't ask ANY technical questions, and more than half the time he was answering the questions I asked about Cisco. So my advice would be to have many questions in mind before going for an interview, and also just to be safe, be ready to talk about your any class projects (in detail) you have worked on.

Like I said, most of the time he was answering my questions -- so there weren't that many questions. I think the fact that he didn't ask any technical question was what I was surprised about.   Answer Question

Well, I repent taking up interview with Cisco. Used to hear that Cisco is a great company to work for, but i did not feel it. Worst University Relations HR. Rude and insensible. The candidate to be selected was kinda fixed, they conducted the written round just for namesake. I was asked to leave (rather rudely) immediately after finishing my offline test. I am sure my paper wasn't even evaluated. And there you go, I travel back home 25 kilometers and then I get a call from someone at Cisco asking me to come back since the candidate which they were planning to hire rejected the offer. And here is the next twist, I receive a call from the same person the next day, asking me not to come since the candidate who rejected the offer has now accepted it. Is this some kinda joke? Nobody would want to be treated that way. It was one horrible mistake to have attended Cisco interview. I would rate 0/5 stars for this company.

I had submitted my resume online in mid-March, and got contacted by HR in early May. I had a phone interview with an administrator who'd be working with me directly, and then a second phone interview with the hiring manager about 30 minutes after the first one. The first interviewer asked me standard interview questions, including "tell me about yourself," "describe your ideal manager," and then "tell me about a time you had to organize a project with people who were based in other locations." (Many of Cisco's employees work remotely, using TelePresence to connect and work with their colleagues.) The interview with the hiring manager was more like a informational interview, in which he told me about the specific position and encouraged me to ask questions. I received an email with an unofficial offer a week later, and then the official HR offer two weeks after that.

The manager was very positive and upbeat. It was a fairly routine interview with many "deep dives" into my past accomplishments and how that would translate and benefit Cisco. I found common ground with the interviewer in order to make a connection to better explain my skill set as well as the skills I was acquiring at school. I did not feel as if this were a high pressure interview or as if the interviewer thought they were superior. The interviewer was very receptive to my questions and answered thoroughly.

Ironically, I didn't feel that there were any unexpected questions during this interview. It was much more of a conversation about my skills, expectations of my internship experience and the standard questions like "walk me through your resume" or "how will Cisco benefit from your skills" or "what is unique to you"...   Answer Question

I went through 2 rounds of interviews. The first interview was on campus and had two local employees interview me with traditional behavioral interview questions. (Tell me about a time when...). The second interview was with a senior manager and to be held on the phone. Unfortunately the guy did not show up for the call. I contacted the recruiter / HR rep to see what had happened, and they rescheduled me for another time, with sincere apologies. The same senior manager interviewed me in the second scheduled call with similar behavioral questions, but never apologized for not showing the first time or even mentioned the rescheduling to any degree. Overall, I really liked the company. It did come across as though they were either no organized, or the senior manager had better things to do than interview candidates.
