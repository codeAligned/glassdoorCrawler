2015-09-25 23:51:18.74,i had an interview on campus in fall 2014 for an internship  but they emailed me back and told me that while the interview went well  they didn t have any positions available at the time. i thought it was just a really nice way of saying  thanks  but no thanks.  fast forward to fall 2015  when my recruiter emailed me and asked me if i would like to go to redmond for interviews since the on campus interview went well last year. i went  and i must say that i was very impressed with microsoft. they drove us potential university recruits to their campus in a limo  the interview process was four 45 minute interviews in a row  with a 15 minute break between each one. i was surprised that i was being interviewed for a group that did higher level programming even though i have studied more low level programming in recent years because i m a computer engineering student. i think some of the other interviewees who were looking for higher level jobs were confused too  because they interviewed most of them for the operating systems track. i m not sure if there was a mix up or not  the interviews themselves were very engaging and the interviewers presented challenging questions. i strongly suspect that one of the people who was interviewing me was texting while i had my back turned and was talking through a problem on the whiteboard  but the rest of it went pretty well. i didn t get an offer  but i m glad i went.,what would keep you from coming to microsoft    answer question
